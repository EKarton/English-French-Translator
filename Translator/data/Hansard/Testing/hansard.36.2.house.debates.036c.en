The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare Motion No. 148 lost.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask if my vote could be recorded among the nays.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
As we have been going through this for the past long while, there have been many members coming in, going out and leaving. 
If we get into members rising to ask if their votes be recorded, then the Chair will also insist that every member be in their place during the time of the vote. 
That means hearing the question and being here until the vote is announced. 
Therefore, I would suggest that we not change any votes, whether people come in or leave.  
The next question is on Motion No. 149. 
A negative vote on Motion No. 149 requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 150 to 158.

I regret that I am not bilingual, but they do not usually translate the results of the vote. 
I would ask the clerk to please announce the results in both languages.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am not sure what particular vote the member was referring to, but that would not be a problem.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the importance of the airline industry to Canada, I am seeking unanimous consent to table the first report of the Standing Committee on Transport.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Hamilton West has sought the unanimous consent of the House to table a report. 
Does the House give its unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.

NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have noted this morning that the opposition members are having a difficult time getting up out of their chairs to vote. 
As this is costing taxpayers $2.4 million- 
Some hon. members:
Shame.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint John may have noticed the same difficulty in this particular chair.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have to tell you that the member for Kootenay-Columbia has spilled water on my chair. 
Therefore I seek to be recognized- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

Mr. John Williams:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. 
I draw to your attention that my hon. colleague spilled a large amount of water on my chair and I am therefore denied the opportunity to take my seat in this House. 
Therefore, I would ask that you suspend the sitting until such time as a new chair can be brought to me.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are a great number of thoughts going through my mind at this moment, none of which I should permit to pass my lips. 
That is definitely not a point of privilege.  
Mr. John Williams:
Mr. Speaker, I thought I raised a serious point of privilege. 
I thought it deserved a reply in the same kind.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for St. Albert may have thought he raised a serious point, but I can assure him that he did not.  
Mr. John Cummins:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You have never been bashful about speaking your mind before. 
Why now? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the deputy whip of the government party for her ingenuity in resolving the issue of the wet chair.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Yes, it did not escape the eyes of the Speaker. 
I thought that the deputy government whip showed a great deal of ingenuity. 
I must say that I was somewhat surprised that the member for St. Albert had not thought of that himself.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall:
Mr. Speaker, not knowing what caused the member for St. Albert's complaint about his wet chair, I am glad to have helped solve it.  
Hon. Herb Gray:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Did the problem have to do with heavy water or some other type of water? 
Clarification would be appreciated.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All right, we have gone as far down that road as we probably should.

I ask my hon. colleagues in the Reform Party if we could take this opportunity to apply the remaining votes and use the moneys that would be saved to pay down the national debt. 
Would they concur with that initiative?  
Mr. Jay Hill:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In response to the hon. member, I wonder if that would be the debt that was accumulated by Canada in the name of the Progressive Conservatives.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All right, we are even. 
Everybody gets one.

Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I simply want to be recorded as having voted against this motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If I understand correctly, the whip has asked for his vote to be recorded in a particular manner. 
Earlier we addressed that issue and it was determined that because there is so much movement, members coming in and out, we would either hold the rules strictly that all members would be in their seats and be recorded at that time or we would provide for people to come and go. 
Therefore, we will not be changing any votes, but we will change the Speaker.

Madam Speaker, I would ask the clerks to check their numbers. 
On the previous vote the numbers were 28 to 54 and this vote was announced as 28 to 74. 
Would 20 members have just walked in?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sure that all members of the House would agree that our clerks today are doing a terrific job.

POINTS OF ORDER 
PAIRING OF MEMBERS 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Some time ago I agreed to officially pair with the Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development between December 2 and December 7, which in effect would indicate that I was deemed to have been present during the course of these proceedings over the last 24 hours.  
I wish to have clarification that that in fact was the case. 
I would also like to have clarification, because I agreed to pair until December 8, which is today, whether the official pairing is still in effect.  
There is one further point. 
Although I agreed to pair with the minister, the pairing book does not indicate the minister's name. 
I would like to confirm that in fact I was paired with the Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development over the last 24 hours.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must advise the hon. member that pairing is a private affair between two members. 
There is a pairing book but it still is private. 
I am not in a position to clarify such an agreement.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Madam Speaker, clearly that is not the case. 
The rules provide for pairing. 
In fact, one of the effects of pairing, as I was told by the Clerk of the House, is that if you were officially paired pursuant to the rules of the House of Commons, that you are deemed to have been present during the course of the voting. 
I would like that confirmed by the Chair.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would like to take this matter under advisement. 
I will get back to the member as soon as possible, but we will continue with the business before us at this point.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, on the same point of order, while you are deliberating, the Reform Party believes that pairing between individuals is between those individuals only.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I have already said that I will take the matter under advisement.

NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
Madam Speaker, while you are deliberating on that particular matter, I have a different point of order. 
I would remind you that some weeks ago at the onset of the Nisga'a debate I rose on a question of privilege. 
I pointed out that the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys- 
An hon. member:
That is debate.  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
No, it is not debate.  
The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that this is revisiting a point that has already been made. 
We will continue.  
The next question is on Motion No. 191.  
The Speaker:
Does the hon. member for Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan have a point of order or a question of privilege?  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
Mr. Speaker, it is actually a point of order arising from a previous question of privilege.  
The Speaker:
I would ask the hon. member to go directly to his point.  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
Mr. Speaker, I only raised it because the previous Speaker was going to deliberate on something. 
Some weeks ago I raised a question of privilege. 
I laid the information before her. 
She promised to get back to me. 
That was several weeks ago and it was in connection with the Nisga'a debate. 
Now we are at the end of that debate and I still have not heard the answer. 
I simply wanted to see if she was going to do that as well.  
The Speaker:
Yes, and we will get back to the hon. member in due course.

POINTS OF ORDER 
PAIRING OF MEMBERS-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The Speaker:
Earlier today the hon. member for York South-Weston raised a point of order seeking clarification for the pairing arrangements he made for December 7, 1999. Some confusion appears to have arisen because, the House not having adjourned, we are still technically in the sitting of December 7, although the calendar has moved on to December 8. 
The standing orders are silent on the reasons for members not participating. 
The standing orders are equally silent on the question of a broken pair. 
There is no penalty provided for nor any corrective action suggested.  
As Erskine May states at page 350 of his 21st edition: 
The Speaker has ruled that agreements to pair are private arrangements between members and in no sense matters in which either he or the House can intervene.  
I would therefore reiterate what my colleague suggested earlier, namely that the specifics of the pairing arrangement for the hon. member for York South-Weston, as made, should be taken up with the member with whom he is pairing. 
Those arrangements will be reflected in the pairing book and Journals will be governed accordingly with regard to the appropriate entries for December 7. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Speaker:
I have ruled on this point of order.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify with regard to pairing that once two members are into a pairing arrangement, as far as the voting is concerned and the official record of the House of Commons, those two members who have agreed to pair and are duly registered in the book are deemed to have voted.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
The Speaker:
Order, please. 
It is my understanding that is incorrect and the clarification has been given.

On the calendar the order of business indicates that on December 7 at 5.30 p.m. we would have had Private Members' Business and debated Motion No. 19 in the name of the hon. member for Skeena. I ask for unanimous consent to have that debate.  
The Speaker:
It was cancelled last night. 
The answer is no.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The next question is on Motion No. 226.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have been at this exercise now for 24 hours, at a total cost of over a million dollars to the Canadian taxpayers. 
It has effectively ground parliament to a halt. 
Is there any- 
The Deputy Speaker:
This is not a point of order, which is why I am interrupting. 
I think the hon. member is engaging in debate. 
I would suggest that if he wants to engage in such debate, since we are holding votes in the Chamber, that he go out into the lobby and do it there. 
We will continue with the next motion.

Earlier in the day I raised with the Speaker the statement you made last night about cell phones not being allowed in the Chamber. 
I presume that the Chamber includes from wall to wall and that cell phones are not permitted behind the curtains either. 
I see a number of people using cell phones in the House and behind the curtains but I will not mention any names.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I hope I have made it clear. 
If the Speaker had better eyesight, I am sure he would chastise certain hon. members who are using cell phones in the Chamber. 
I know they will want to refrain from doing so in future on every side of the House.

What is going on?

Oh, oh.

The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas is an experienced member and he knows it is completely out of order to refer to the absence of members from the House. 
I am surprised he would be so mischievous.  
Mr. John Cummins:

It should be noted that when this matter was debated in the House the members down at the far end could seldom find someone to step up and debate the issue.

However much merriment these kinds of comments may provoke, they are not helpful and they are out of order. 
I urge hon. members to comply with the rules in every respect.

I hope the hon. member for Calgary Southeast is not going to refer to the absence of members.

I believe the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo has a camera in the House and I want to ask you to confirm whether or not pictures are being taken in the House by that hon. member.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I do not see him. 
I am sure the chief government whip will have a word with the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo at once if this in fact is happening and will deal with the matter.  
Mr. Randy White:
Mr. Speaker, we have been through this once before today and I do not intend to go through it again. 
Once before today one of our members was photographed in the House. 
In fact it was me. 
There is an apology awaiting.  
The point I want to make to all my colleagues in the House is that this is most improper and should not be tolerated by any one of us.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Earlier today I indicated the Chair's disapproval of such conduct. 
I am sure if the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo were here he would explain very quickly whether or not he had taken any pictures with his camera.  
I did not see anything going on and so I am not in a position to do much more. 
I am sure the chief government whip will raise the matter with the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo and the House will hear about it later.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy:
Mr. Speaker, would it not be correct for all hon. members in the House to wear the proper attire and stay awake? 
Then there would be no need to worry about cameras.

It is my understanding that when a motion comes before the House of Commons the mover and seconder of the motion must be in the House, and if not you dispense with it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I can certainly understand why the member for Saint John would wonder about that. 
During report stage or other stages of the bill that is the case unless there is a special order to provide for that.  
In this case all the votes were deferred until 5.30 tonight. 
This is normal procedure and things are being done as they should be.  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

On behalf of all members, Shaughnessy's family and all those who knew her, loved her and worked with her, I think this is a most appropriate point of order.  
It is hard not to think of Shaughnessy being here today. 
If she were here there would be a few brickbats going and she would be making my life quite enjoyable.
