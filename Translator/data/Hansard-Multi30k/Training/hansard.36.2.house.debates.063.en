The House met at 11 a.m. 
Prayers 
PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS 
WESTRAY MINE 
The House resumed from March 3 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure for me to talk about this issue which stems from an awful disaster that happened in 1992 in Nova Scotia not too far from my riding. 
I remember it well. 
I was the member of parliament for Cumberland-Colchester at the time. 
I represent an area that has a large number of coal mines and we have seen our share of coal mine disasters in Springhill, River Hebert, Joggins and all those places that thrived on coal in the early years. 
This motion is very dear to my heart.  
The father of the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough who initiated this motion was the member of parliament for that area. 
I remember going to the scene of the disaster and the Hon. Elmer MacKay was there virtually 24 hours a day until it was determined that there was no more hope for the 26 miners lost. 
He worked with the people hand in hand and was always present to help them.  
I want to congratulate my colleague from Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough for working so hard to ensure that workplace safety is a top priority of the Government of Canada as well as the business community.  
We will be voting on this motion. 
It will be interesting to see which members are in favour of amending the criminal code to protect workers in Canada from coast to coast. 
I am confident this motion will gain the support of the entire House or at least one would certainly hope so considering the ramifications.  
That just happened hours ago and it sounds exactly like what happened in Westray. 
The draegermen were bringing up the bodies. 
It was such a sad thing and to think it could have been avoided.  
I would like to take a moment this morning to read the motion. 
Motion No. 79 states: 
That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring that corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety.  
What could make more sense than that? 
The awful thing is that the study to which the hon. member refers was started in 1992 and was just tabled in 1997. 
His motion stems from that study.  
The need for a rational standard of business behaviour goes without saying. 
However it is every bit as important that once the laws are established, provisions are created to ensure that bureaucrats do not tokenize the enforcement of those laws. 
There can be no double standards.  
Enforcement administrators often give way to political influences that persuade them that enforcement of workplace legislation will sacrifice jobs and scare away industry. 
Enforcement apathy is often rationalized by the political suggestion that by giving a company the right amount of time the problem will be fixed. 
This is often proven blatantly untrue.  
Those people who have been persuaded that jobs and votes are higher priorities than life enter into a clear conflict of interest and it must stop. 
Many well-intentioned business executives agree with this motion because it provides safety legislation in the workplace. 
However there are still some who do not. 
Sadly the benefits of their behaviours accrue only to those executives and those people involved, while the workers, their families and ultimately the Canadian taxpayer pay for their gain. 
In fact current tax credit laws favour non-compliant employers.  
Collectively workers represent the wealthiest group of people and consumers in the country. 
It is from these workers that taxes are collected which in turn fund the infrastructure which stimulates an environment that creates additional wealth, so long as the workers and employees remain healthy.  
When injured, taxpayers often pay the financial costs of rehabilitation, death benefits, retraining and lost productivity that exceeds $16 billion annually. 
Every day through their efforts Canadian workers earn the right to be protected with enforceable legislation.  
As an investment it is good business and cost justified to protect Canadian employees. 
A small number of executives still escape liability because their lawyers show them how to hide behind jurisdictional boundaries. 
Even if convicted of violating the occupational health and safety statutes, existing provincial penalties are minimal compared to the rewards generated by their violation. 
This motion would require total accountability of executives with no loopholes.  
Unfortunately we have seen many examples of occupational safety in the workplace taking second spot behind the bottom line, especially in the mining industry where the very nature of the work involves a great deal of risk. 
It is the duty of company officers to ensure the work is done in the safest possible conditions.  
I again refer to the newspaper article about the Ukrainian explosion which so mirrors the Westray explosion. 
The miners usually blame accidents on the unwillingness of officials to spend money on maintaining or upgrading safety equipment. 
History certainly has repeated itself there.  
Often corporate executives sometimes seem less interested in the merits of workplace safety in pursuit of the bottom line. 
This is a very dangerous scenario. 
We must be mindful of it and do everything we can to prevent it.  
In the case of the Westray tragedy, labour safety standards, in particular minimal safety standards, were not adhered to to the extent they should have been, much like we have read about regarding the Ukrainian explosion.  
Looking at this issue in the larger context, there must also be recognition of the role of government to ensure proper standards are met, not only set but met. 
It stands to reason that when weighing business goals versus those of safety, sometimes businesses find themselves pulled in many ways. 
Far too often businesses and indeed heads of corporations are obsessed with financial gain leaving the safety of their workers neglected. 
That type of short term gain often results in long term pain, as was the case at Westray.  
That is a sad commentary on safety in the mining industry and the executives involved in that industry. 
A predictable path; they could have predicted that the disaster was going to happen, yet it still did.  
Safety regulations, management and government all failed in their duties to those miners. 
Tough economic times which exist in the country put further pressure on workers. 
That is why this is so timely. 
The economic impact of having to shut down a corporation affects everyone in that company. 
The employees, management, board of directors and anyone associated with that business are going to feel a negative impact if there has to be an operational shutdown as a result of a potential breach of safety.  
That is the cost of doing business and we have to do everything to ensure that those safety practices are followed. 
In the case of Westray they were almost trivial things which were overlooked: sensors shut down, alarms disconnected, comments from the miners disregarded, and things like that.  
Companies must ensure the avoidance of hazardous or illegal practices such as those which cannot be condoned in any capacity. 
If companies have not already done so, they should do everything within their power to implement safe and ethical work practices. 
Ethics such as these should be studied and followed everywhere in places of employment, especially in upper management. 
If this is not the case, action must be taken to demonstrate the importance and seriousness of the issue. 
Business executives must promote and nurture safe work ethics and have an open and approachable attitude toward all employees.  
As Nova Scotia experienced with the Westray disaster, senior bureaucrats within the provincial workplace and enforcement agencies became compromised by regional politics and vested interests. 
This practice is suspected to be occurring in other provinces even today, almost eight years after that explosion.  
It is time now that we in the House pull together and do something to address those issues.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address this motion. 
For me, one of the most profound and distressing events that occurred in Nova Scotia during my 14 years of serving as leader of the New Democratic Party in that province was the Westray disaster, which absolutely avoidably and unnecessarily cost 26 miners their lives and cost their families the loss of loved ones.  
I am torn by conflicting emotions as we discuss this motion. 
On the one hand I am filled with hope, and I think many Canadian workers will be, that health and safety is the subject of debate in the House. 
That is a very important thing and I want to commend the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough for bringing forward this motion and other members of the House who have risen to support the motion that is before us. 
The needless loss of 26 miners still buried beneath the ground has not been forgotten, and that is a very important message.  
As the previous member who spoke indicated, one cannot be unmindful of the chilling news of the death of 80 miners in Ukraine which has occurred in the last few days. 
Let us not be so smug in the House as to think that the same kind of unsafe conditions, the same kind of neglect by employers and governments cannot repeat itself in Canada. 
Until we take serious legislative measures to put in place the protections that are necessary, including an enactment in legislation of the sentiment of this motion, this situation can and indeed will occur again.  
The disappointing thing at this point in the debate about this very important health and safety topic is that it would appear that it is the intention of the federal Liberal government to never really put this debate into action. 
The intention of the government is not only to try to forget the lost lives at Westray, but to ignore the simple, horrifying reality across the country that there are workers who continue to be put into unsafe working conditions and the people who put them there remain immune from criminal responsibility.  
There will be, no doubt, Liberal members of parliament who will stand in protest and they too will proclaim their concern, their care about Canadian workers, how they hope a disaster like Westray will never again happen. 
However, until we enact legislation that embodies the spirit of this motion, then such speeches will be little more than empty rhetoric.  
Motion No. 79 is just that, it is a motion. 
It has no legislative implications. 
Indeed we have seen in the past that this government will from time to time support such motions, only to ignore the issue in its entirety when it comes to enacting legislation to express the intent of the motion.  
However, in this case the government will not be allowed to fool the Canadian people so easily because it is our responsibility to ensure that the government is forced to act upon this.  
At issue in this motion is recommendation No. 73 of the exhaustive Westray report. 
That recommendation would establish criminal responsibility for decision makers who knowingly put their workers at undue risk. 
It is the basis for this motion and the basis for my private member's Bill C-259.  
Supporting the motion which is before us would tell Canadian workers that their representatives will stand for them. 
Supporting Bill C-259 would show Canadian workers that their representatives will stand for them. 
Unfortunately, the government appears determined to send a very different message.  
I bring to the attention of the House where the Liberal government stands today on workplace safety. 
I will quote from letters written by members of the government in response to my requests for support for Bill C-259. 
What did the Minister of Labour say? 
She said that it falls under the jurisdiction of the justice department. 
The translation of her statement is that worker safety is not the labour minister's problem.  
I share your concern that people in Canada should not be able to hold themselves above the law...my 
officials are giving this recommendation every consideration.  
The translation of that statement is ``We have had three years to do something about this, but don't hold your breath''.  
I think the clincher comes from the Prime Minister's office: 
I share your concerns about the Westray Mine explosion...that is why the government has a comprehensive range of programs to promote workplace safety.  
If the existing regime did the job, then there would not have been 26 miners' lives lost in the Westray explosion.  
I plead with members of the House to recognize that this is not a partisan issue. 
We all know that every member elected to the House of Commons has constituents who, at this very moment, as we speak about the motion which is before us, are working in unsafe conditions, who are forced to work in unsafe conditions because of the inadequacy of the legislation that exists in the country.  
Whether to stand for those working Canadians is not a choice. 
Standing for those Canadians working in unsafe health and safety conditions is our obligation and I urge every member of the House to vote in support of the motion which is before us.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Motion No. 79. 
I commend the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough for his commitment to this issue and his foresight in introducing this motion in the House of Commons for debate.  
It is unfortunate that an issue of this importance-the issue of accountability for corporate executives and occupational safety-is not taken more seriously by the government. 
The Westray disaster of May 9, 1992 continues to resonate as a beacon of what should be done to improve worker safety, not just in Canada but around the world.  
Earlier today I heard the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester speak of the recent mine disaster in Ukraine. 
Canada can play a role in introducing changes to our criminal code that would be world leading in terms of their impact on occupational health and safety issues and corporate accountability, not just in Canada but around the world.  
It was one of the few times I listened to national public radio in New York. 
I was running in Central Park when I heard the news. 
It was one of the few times that I ever heard about Nova Scotia in the U.S. national media. 
The sadness continues to affect those families, whose lives have been forever changed by the disaster.  
I am not surprised that the government is opposed to improving corporate accountability on occupational health and safety issues. 
This is the same government that ignores issues of accountability even for its cabinet ministers. 
One of the fundamental tenets of our democratic system and of parliamentary democracy is the accountability of ministers of the crown. 
The government ignores even the accountability of ministers in its own cabinet. 
For example, the debacle with the HRDC minister has focused the attention of Canadians on issues of waste in government in recent weeks. 
I guess it is consistent with this government that it continues to ignore issues of accountability, whether it is corporate accountability in the case of Motion No. 79 or ministerial accountability in terms of the government's malaise in effecting positive change with respect to the accountability of its own ministers.  
The chilling message that came from the Westray disaster was that even today, in this day and age, occupational health and safety issues continually are ignored by companies, particularly, it would seem, in the coal mining industry, but in other sectors as well.  
Increasingly executives are compensated based on stock options. 
While that can be very positive in terms of creating a synergistic relationship between the goals of the executive from a compensatory perspective and the goals of the shareholders by encouraging executives to maximize shareholder value, it can also focus the efforts of executives on very short term results which can often have a negative impact on the long term results of a company, whether it is corporate and financial, or in this case the safety of workers.  
We cannot put a price on life. 
It is impossible to value human life on a balance sheet or on an earnings statement. 
Often companies are so focused on the bottom line that they forget the basics of humanity in terms of providing a safe work space for workers who, every day of their lives in the coal mining industry, in this case, risk their lives.  
Government needs to provide a role in overseeing and ensuring that on an ongoing basis these workers are protected by changing the criminal code as recommended by the Westray inquiry. 
With this legislation we would ensure that government continue to play the very important role that only government can play to ensure that the corporate sector does its part to ensure the safety of workers in what is a very dangerous industry.  
Part of the issue as well is temptation. 
Far too often in areas like Atlantic Canada that have seen significant economic issues and a downturn over the last 30 years, in the haste to attract and to maintain industry there is a tendency to turn a blind eye to some of the health and safety issues. 
That very short term focus is going to have some very negative long term results.  
The Government of Canada can play a proactive role in the same light that the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough is playing a proactive visionary role in introducing this motion. 
The government can play a proactive visionary role in actually supporting legislation to ensure that there are not different sets of health and safety standards for different regions of the country. 
Just because a region has some economic downturn issues, the workers in that region should not have to suffer with poorer occupational health standards.  
The legislation proposed in the motion would effect change in the criminal code which would actually ensure that across Canada corporate executives faced the same stringent level of accountability. 
Atlantic Canada would see, whether it is in the coal mining industry or another industry, a greater level of protection for workers. 
They go to work every day and struggle to make ends meet, to try to build a better future for themselves, for their families and for Canada. 
They should not have to live under the pall of a daily unnecessary threat to their lives and their safety because of corporate negligence.  
I encourage all members of the House to support Motion No. 79. 
I commend the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough for proposing very sound legislation in the motion. 
We need to ensure that occupational health and safety issues are dealt with in the same way that environmental issues are dealt with strongly by the criminal code.  
Corporate executives must be responsible not just to their shareholders but to Canadians at large, to the workers who toil in the mines, to the wildlife that depend on a clean environment. 
We need to ensure that environmental standards, health and safety and occupational health issues are dealt with appropriately.  
The only way to deal with these issues in the economically driven and globally competitive society we live in today is through strong changes to the criminal code to ensure that all workers are safe in their workplace. 
All corporate executives must do everything they can to ensure that Canada has the highest standards in occupational health and safety in the world.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it was not my intention to speak to the motion. 
However because the previous three members who spoke have more or less moved away from the generalities of the motion and directed their attention solely to the Westray disaster, I would like to make a contribution. 
I am a mining engineer by profession and I have worked many years underground in many parts of the world. 
I would like to give the House my particular take on this disaster.  
The last member who spoke made specific reference to the negligence of the regulatory system. 
He did not use those words but I will use them. 
I believe that the heart of the problem at Westray was that there was such enormous political pressure to open this mine in the first place, when there was good advice from mining experts that it was not a viable operation, that the shaft should never have been sunk, that they had had methane problems in that area historically every time they tried to mine there. 
There was definitely a recommendation that the mine not be developed. 
However, because of provincial and federal pressures and the huge amounts of government money put forward to get this thing going, there was also pressure on the regulatory system. 
As I understand it, and I stand to be corrected, I believe the mine inspector was under considerable pressure not to shut that operation down.  
When I was working in the mines, I never ever encountered a situation where line management was anything but safety conscious. 
Line managers would do whatever was necessary to keep a mine safe. 
They had the advantage of having the mine inspectors behind them. 
In other words, even if management in Toronto said they had to get production up, line management could still do whatever was necessary to keep the mine safe. 
We are perhaps shooting at the wrong target here. 
The problem at Westray was safety enforcement. 
Perhaps we might say that line management was guilty but the mine inspection system failed. 
Any mine inspector should have been able to spot the violations which have been described here which took place in that mine.  
Because there was this one particular disaster, let us not talk about revamping a law which has served us well over the years. 
That is the law which exempts directors. 
I am not talking about executives or line management; I am talking about directors. 
Who in the devil would want to be the director of a company if he or she was going to be held responsible for things that are happening out in the field? 
The directors do not make managerial decisions. 
They have nothing to do with it.  
A man would have to be insane to accept a directorial position for which he is paid a very small amount of money with most companies. 
There are directors of multinational companies who are well paid, but the directors of most companies work for an honorarium. 
They get paid so much a meeting and that is it. 
Who would take on a position like that? 
Not me, not if I were going to be held responsible for something that happened 2,000 or 3,000 miles away that I did not know anything about and had no input into.  
A group of miners was unnecessarily killed because the inspection system did not work. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Madam Speaker, first of all, I wish to congratulate the hon. member sponsoring this motion for his tenacity, since I recall this motion being discussed in a previous session. 
He has now been faithful to himself and introduced it again, in light of the seriousness of the issue it raises.  
A mine explosion in Nova Scotia raised the question of whether the legislation was or was not equal to the task of properly handling a similar situation. 
The government of the province mandated Justice Peter Richard to carry out a public inquiry in order to cast light on all of the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.  
An extremely sizeable report, released in November 1997, provided a chronology of all of the events and a highly detailed analysis of the legislation. 
The judge primarily addressed provincial labour law, however, in keeping with the Nova Scotia ministerial order.  
Hon. members will realize we will set aside that part of the report that addresses provincial legislation, because this is the federal level and we do not want to do what the federal government is generating complaints for doing, namely meddling in jurisdictions which are not ours.  
The judge did make some comments on the Criminal Code and call for certain things. 
We should perhaps act on his observations in view of what he asked and show how seriously we take the report.  
I repeat this, because I think it important: we support the motion of the Conservative member, but we would like it to be examined in the light of federal legislation. 
In order for this to occur, the motion has to be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for consideration.  
I move: 
That the motion be amended by adding the following between the words ``amended'' and ``in accordance'': ``following study by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights''.  
Once this study is complete, federal legislation may be really focused accordingly and in appropriate response to the judge in the matter.  
I will quote what the judge said in this regard and more precisely recommendation 73 of the report, which the Conservative member's motion refers to. 
Recommendation 73 of the Richard report reads as follows: 
The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, should institute a study of the accountability of corporate executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of the corporation and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety.  
This recommendation gives us the opening I mentioned earlier to intervene in this matter and especially to do a detailed study of all aspects of mining safety. 
I therefore move this amendment.  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Prior to the expiry of private members' hour I wish to advise the Chair that following consultations with my colleagues from all parties, I believe you will find there is unanimous consent to defer the vote on Motion No. 79 until Tuesday, March 21, 2000 at the end of government orders.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent of the House to proceed in such a manner?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House as a member from Nova Scotia to discuss the merits of Motion No. 79 put forward by the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, one of my neighbouring ridings.  
I want to thank the hon. member for bringing the motion to debate in the House of Commons. 
I believe that health and safety is something that should be debated in the House of Commons on a regular basis.  
On behalf of the New Democratic Party, and on behalf of workers across the country, I would like to offer a solemn prayer and hope in our hearts for the wives and children of the 80 miners who were recently killed in a blast in Ukraine. 
I believe I speak on behalf of all members of the House of Commons in sending our sincere condolences to everyone in Ukraine.  
This motion works in conjunction with Bill C-259, a private member's bill which the hon. member for Halifax, the leader of the New Democratic Party, introduced concerning workers' health and safety rights and bringing those who are criminally responsible to justice.  
What happened at Westray did not have to happen. 
Miners and their families are very concerned about their loved ones who go underground on a daily basis to earn their bread, and to pay their taxes so that we in the House of Commons can put forth legislation to protect them. 
For us to ignore their demands and wishes is a dereliction of our responsibilities and our duties. 
We simply cannot allow this to happen any longer.  
There was an exhaustive Westray report which made some very serious and admirable recommendations, but that report is now three years old. 
What has the government done? 
Absolutely nothing. 
I wonder if it is waiting for the next mine disaster before doing something. 
Is it waiting for an election to be called before it enacts legislation? 
It seems that is the only thing that will make the federal Liberals move.  
After a balanced and exhaustive report which was done to improve the lives and the health and safety of workers in the communities, especially in the extremities of the country outside Ottawa, the government sits on the report and does absolutely nothing.  
Our party was founded on the principles of workers' safety and workers' rights. 
We started in the CCF, with J. S. Woodsworth, right up to the NDP led by the hon. member for Halifax. 
We have been fighting day in and day out with our provincial counterparts and our friends in the labour movement, with the CLC, to fight for and protect workers' rights throughout the country.  
On average, three workers lose their lives on a daily basis. 
Three workers is three workers too many.  
When I was growing up in Vancouver, 15 workers lost their lives working on the Portmann Bridge.  
There was absolutely no moral leadership, and for any government to support those two people over workers' rights is absolutely disastrous and scandalous.  
I encourage the entire House to support Motion No. 79 put forward by my hon. colleague from Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment moved by the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm is in order.  
It being 11.50 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired. 
Accordingly, the question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
Some hon. members:
Yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
Some hon. members:
Nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the recorded division stands deferred until Tuesday, March 21, at the end of the time provided for Government Orders.  
The Speaker:
Before I hear a point of order from the hon. parliamentary secretary, I would inform the House that I have received two letters this morning. 
I received a letter from the hon. member for Verchères-Les-Patriotes, chief whip of the Bloc Quebecois, and another from the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis, deputy leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
These letters have to do with the question of privilege raised earlier by the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
If these are new questions of privilege, I will hear them. 
If this is about the question of privilege that was raised earlier by the hon. member, I will hear members on new facts surrounding that question, since I am now in the process of preparing the ruling regarding this question of privilege.  
If there are new facts, I will hear them.

PRIVILEGE 
AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-20 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is extremely important that I raise this question of privilege regarding what I told you about on March 1, and regarding the point of order raised by the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry, on Friday, March 3.  
At the time, I asked you to examine a serious violation of the privileges as parliamentarians of Bloc Quebecois members in this House.  
I gave you proof that the deputy principal clerk had rejected amendments that we had not even tabled with the Journals Branch, since he based his decision on the legislative counsel's data bank, rather than on the amendments actually tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.  
I demonstrated to you that the freedom of speech of the members of my party and their right to confidential dealings with the legislative counsel had been violated.  
Not only had the House staff usurped the right of the Bloc MPs to select the amendments they intended to propose, but it also committed a breach of confidentiality by consulting the body of amendments the Bloc Quebecois had had the legislative counsel prepare.  
At the time I raised this question of privilege, I expressed serious misgivings about the decision making process surrounding the receivability of the amendments at the report stage. 
In fact, certain amendments that were declared out of order were amended in accordance with the comments by the Deputy Principal Clerk in order to render them in order. 
Yet they were again deemed to be out of order.  
This new decision was then made the object of a point of order by my colleague for Beauharnois-Salaberry who expressed, on behalf of his colleagues, his dismay about this new refusal by your staff. 
These events, which occurred during the week prior to last week's parliamentary recess, have a negative effect on the debate at report stage on Bill C-20, which was begun on Friday, March 3 and is scheduled to resume today.  
Some amendments will be neither debated nor voted on, while we have serious reservations about the grounds on which the staff based the decision that they were not in order. 
The very process by which amendments were selected might be questioned, as it seems to be tainted by a number of defects and irregularities.  
On these grounds, Mr. Speaker, you have a duty to bring down your decision on my point of privilege of March 1 last, and on the point of order raised by my colleague for Beauharnois-Salaberry, and to do so before resuming the debate at report stage and before beginning today's voting process, because the government House leader is obviously preparing to propose a time allocation motion, which will force the House to decide on the motions at report stage starting at 6.30 this evening.  
The Bloc Quebecois will have great difficulty in taking part in a process of debate and voting which is a deviation from the rules and conventions of this House.  
Do not treat this point of privilege lightly. 
The gravity of the situation imposes a duty to exercise diligence. 
The credibility of the institution that is the House of Commons is at stake.  
I would remind you that I am still prepared to make the necessary motion to return this matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, particularly the one element-for my point of privilege involved two matters-relating to the examination of a motion of privilege, which would refer to that committee the question raised by the rejection of two never-introduced amendments.  
Before the debate is resumed, or as promptly as possible, and especially before we vote, I expect your decision on the point of order raised by my colleague for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
The Speaker:
I have heard no new facts at this point. 
I ask the members again, if they wish to intervene, to keep to the facts. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Speaker:
What the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois has just said is very serious. 
It questions the position of the Speaker of the House. 
We must absolutely be impartial. 
We must manage as the rules we have here require. 
I hope the impartiality of the Speaker of the House of Commons will never be challenged.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Mr. Speaker, if we were to vote without hearing a decision or a ruling on what was raised, which is very serious, my colleagues and I would be in such a situation.  
I want to know whether the ruling will be given before we vote.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois just presented in a very eloquent way the problem that confronts us.  
A question of privilege was originally raised by the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis, who just reminded you of its nature. 
There is at least one new development, namely that the government is about to impose closure, with the result that we will likely begin to vote this evening, at 6.30 p.m., on the various amendments proposed at report stage of Bill C-20. 
This creates two problems. 
The first one, which was raised by the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis, is that two of our amendments, on which we worked with the legislative counsel, were deemed out of order before even having been tabled.  
This greatly affected our ability to actually table these amendments later on, since they were deemed out of order before even having been tabled. 
This is not to mention the much more fundamental issue of the confidentiality that must exist between each member of parliament and the legislative counsels.  
As for the voting process that will likely begin this evening, you will agree with me that it poses a problem.  
Explanations were provided to us by the Deputy Principal Clerk, who told us why these amendments had been deemed out of order.  
We went back to the drawing board. 
We rewrote these amendments by taking into account the points raised and, surprise, these amendments were again deemed to be out of order.  
You will agree that, if you were to rule in favour of the question of privilege raised by my colleague, it would then be necessary to include in the various groups of amendments all those amendments that were deemed out of order for a reason that we feel totally unjustified. 
It would be necessary to include these amendments in the various groups, so that they could be voted on this evening.  
You will agree that we cannot possibly begin the debate on the amendments to Bill C-20. Moreover, we cannot begin to vote on these amendments if the Chair has not rendered its decision.  
I want to stress what the Bloc Quebecois leader just said. 
If we were faced with the prospect of beginning the debate and, worse yet, of voting on the amendments proposed at report stage of Bill C-20, without the Chair having first made its ruling, we would have no other choice but to conclude that Bloc Quebecois members are not treated impartially.  
The Speaker:
You are facing me with a dilemma. 
I intend to render my decision before the voting this evening.  
It is a bit of a concern to me that an hon. member is questioning the impartiality of the Chair of this House. 
I know that the matters we are going to discuss, debate and vote on today are very important ones.  
As I have said, I intended to bring down my ruling before the votes, but I do not know when the voting will take place. 
Perhaps it will be this evening, as he said, at 6.30 p.m. Perhaps it will be next week. 
I do not know at this point, because I have no document or opinion before me indicating how we are going to proceed.  
It is troubling, however, that the Chair be asked to tell when this will be done, or face having his impartiality questioned. 
It is my intention to bring down my rulings before today's voting. 
If that is what the hon. member wanted to know, that is my intention.

POINTS OF ORDER 
MOTIONS IN AMENDMENTTO BILL C-20-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The Speaker:
I am now prepared to deal with the point of order raised by the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry on March 3, 2000 relating to certain motions in amendment to Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference, which were found out of order.  
I would like to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  
The hon. member stated that the motions in amendment submitted to the journals branch were intended to clarify the working of clauses 1(5) and 2(3) of Bill C-20 and did not go beyond the scope of the bill. 
He maintained that, because the amendments were ruled out of order, not only was he prevented from debating them but that this action interfered with the rights of all members of the House and constituted a restriction on his freedom of expression and that of other members.  
I can assure the hon. member that the scope and substance of the amendments submitted by him were carefully considered.  
I also want to underline to the hon. member and the House that, while preliminary assessments about such matters may be taken by officials of the House, the review and approval of such decisions remain the responsibility of the Speaker. 
It is a responsibility that I take very seriously.  
I refer the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry to page 666 of the House of Commons Procedure and Practice . 
I wish to reassure the member that the decision is purely procedural and not based in any way on whether the subject matter is worthy of debate. 
It was made in accordance with the traditions and practices of this House.  
For these reasons, I must conclude that the matter does not constitute a valid point of order. 
I thank the hon. member for raising this issue and trust that this ruling has been helpful to him and to other hon. members.  
Further to the question raised by the member for Rimouski-Mitis on Friday, March 3, 2000, I wish to inform the House that there was an error in the table for the voting on Bill C-20. The vote on Motion No. 70 will apply to Motion No. 71. 
A revised voting table is available from the table. 
I regret any inconvenience this may have caused the hon. members.

PRIVILEGE 
AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-20-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The Speaker:
The deputy House leader of the Bloc Quebecois raised a question of privilege on March 1, 2000 relating to the rejection of two motions in amendment to Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference.  
These motions in amendment, declared out of order by the clerks involved with the bill, were never forwarded to the journals branch for inclusion in the Notice Paper.  
I also want to acknowledge the contributions of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, the hon. member for Verchères-Les-Patriotes, as well as the House leader for the Reform Party on this subject.  
The acting House leader stated that on Tuesday, February 29, 2000, the Deputy Principal Clerk of the legislative unit forwarded a letter to the office of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois presenting the procedural details for rejecting some 700 motions in amendment to Bill C-20. These motions in amendment were appended to the letter. 
The Bloc Quebecois had, in fact, never forwarded two of the motions in amendment bearing the reference numbers 5180 and 5163 to the journals branch for inclusion in the Notice Paper.  
After inquiries by the office of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, it became clear that the clerks working on the bill had made an error by including reference to those two motions in the covering letter. 
The acting House leader argued that the privileges of the Bloc Quebecois members and all members of the House have been breached because of the actions of these clerks involved in the performance of their duties, namely consulting a database that the member contends is intended for the exclusive use of the legislative counsel.  
The member went on to assert that the relationship of confidentiality that must exist between the legislative counsel and those members who request the drafting of amendments had been breached and that this action constituted a contempt of the House.  
On behalf of all members of the House, I have looked carefully into the actions and events related to this matter. 
Hon. members should understand that House legislative counsel do not work in isolation.  
They are part of an operational team that supports the legislative work of the Chamber and its committees. 
This group is comprised of procedural clerks as well as legal drafters who are assisted in their functions by text processing operators and administrative support staff. 
The confidentiality to which the acting House leader refers is shared by all staff within this group for operational purposes.  
There is no separate database for legislative counsel as the hon. member suggests. 
The legislative database supports the work of all persons having duties within the field of legislative support operations.  
Members should also understand that with respect to report stage, there must be interaction between the staff of the legislative services group, the clerk of the committee to which the bill was referred, and the staff of the journals branch.  
All staff of the House working in support of members in their legislative function are governed by strict confidentiality with regard to persons outside their operational field and, of course, vis-à-vis other members.  
In this case, I note there is no mention of any breach of confidentiality whereby the text of proposed motions of the hon. member or her party has been made known to persons working outside the field of legislative support operations or to other members. 
Confidential information proprietary to the Bloc Quebecois and several of its members remained completely and absolutely confidential. 
Consequently, I am unable to find that this constitutes a prima facie question of privilege or a contempt of the House.  
I thank the acting House leader of the Bloc Quebecois for bringing this matter to my attention and permitting me to make this clarification to the House.  
* * * 
AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET OUT IN THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN THE QUEBEC SECESSION REFERENCE 
The House resumed from March 3 consideration of Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, at this point I will use the three minutes I have remaining to remind the House of why we are here and why we will end up in the position we seem to be inexorably heading toward tonight.  
After the 1995 referendum there was a decision to ask the supreme court what we might do in the event of another referendum. 
The court said very clearly that in a democracy like Canada, should there be a clear expression of the will of a population in a region of Canada on a clear question about the secession of that province, the Government of Canada would be obligated to negotiate. 
The government has come forward with a piece of legislation that puts that decision into law and nothing more. 
It adheres very closely to the decision of the supreme court.  
I note that the New Democratic Party and its House leader, who was a member on the committee, worked hard to review the bill and put forward amendments. 
I note that even the Reform Party came forward in support of the bill and also looked at ways in which the bill could be improved.  
Therefore, we end up in a very sad place, a place where it is no longer possible to debate. 
I am sorry that we are here, but we are here. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity to speak briefly to Bill C-20. 
The clarity bill, as it has been called, is a bill which the official opposition supports in principle. 
I might say that we support it in principle because we think that confusion is antidemocratic.  
However, we disagree with the haste of this process. 
We disagree with the imposition of time allocation. 
We disagree with the arbitrary nature that the committee used to decide who would appear as witnesses before the committee. 
I will not spend a lot of time on those things because that disagreement has been well documented.  
We believe that a well informed public is better than a confused public. 
On an issue as important as the breakup of our country, to be well informed is very sensible.  
It is not often that a politician makes a comment about his opposing politician. 
However, I would like to make a positive comment about the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs across the way. 
He has not changed his tune since he made up his mind that he was going to look for clarity from the supreme court and carry it through. 
I give him credit for that. 
He has been castigated in his home province. 
He has been called unpleasant things. 
He has been made fun of in caricatures. 
I would like him to know personally that I do not agree with any of those things. 
I think he has been at least honourable on this subject.  
We can disagree with him, and I believe that it is fair to do do, but in this instance I do not disagree with him. 
I want him to know personally that I think the characterizations have not been accurate nor proper.  
I will spend a moment on the committee hearings to talk about what I found most interesting. 
I attended all of the meetings and found the old politicians to be the most interesting people who appeared before the committee.  
First, two of the witnesses I listened to opposed Bill C-20. Claude Ryan, who is a man with enormous prestige in Quebec, opposes Bill C-20, as well as Joe Clark, a politician who has had many years of constitutional battles. 
I will not make comments about the reasons they oppose the bill. 
They have reasons which I think are debatable and arguable. 
However, those two senior politicians both oppose Bill C-20. 
I looked at those who came in support of Bill C-20. I found it interesting that some of them fought those constitutional battles with vigour themselves. 
I will list four of them:
Claude Castonguay, le père de l'assurance-santé, the father of medicare in Quebec, is supportive of Bill C-20; Gil Rémillard, a senior politician who has had long experience in Quebec, supports Bill C-20 as well; and two politicians from outside Quebec, Ed Broadbent and Bob Rae, both came to the committee and said they support the bill.  
I also want to reflect on what Reformers think of the clarity bill. 
I had the opportunity to poll Reformers. 
It is fascinating that when asked if a clear question was important, 98.7% of Reformers who responded said yes. 
This bill does not do that. 
That probably reflects my position that the majority level could and should be spelled out.  
I tried to reflect, all the way through the committee hearings, on whether the question last time was clear. 
My way of deciding was not to listen to those who on one side or the other have an axe to grind, but to ask those who are experts in asking questions of the public, and to my mind they are the pollsters, those who do polling all the time. 
The pollsters told me that when asking loaded questions we cannot expect anything but a loaded answer. 
They ask ``yes-no'' questions, which of course the referendum did as well.  
When I asked the pollsters if the last question asked of Quebecers was unambiguous or unconfusing, they said no, it was neither; it was both ambiguous and confusing.  
I posed to the pollsters what kind of question they would ask. 
To that question there would be a response, yes or no.  
I think that most Quebecers would probably answer yes, that they would like to enter into a new partnership with Canada. 
My analysis is that there are lots of people within and outside Quebec who would like to have a new relationship with Ottawa, and that relationship with Ottawa could well reflect a country that was advancing, a country that was improving, a country with a vigorous future. 
However, when asked if that new partnership fails would they want to split up Canada, I think the response might well be different. 
I know that there is very little appetite for splitting up the country outside Quebec, and certainly not in my part of the country.  
Bill C-20 is imperfect. 
It could have been improved. 
It is a step in the right direction. 
In principle it is supportable. 
The official opposition will be supporting the bill unamended. 
I think it literally will not be amended, unless there is some surprise awaiting us.  
It has been a privilege to represent interests from the western part of the country on the bill.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words before this bill clears the House. 
In that respect, I want to reiterate my view that this bill has been rushed through in a way that has discredited the parliamentary process.  
For the record, it has been one of the low points in my parliamentary life, watching the way this bill has been handled, both by the government and in some respects also by the Bloc Quebecois, because it has created a situation in which something as important as the legislative framework for the secession of a province from Canada has not been able to be studied in the way that it should have been studied. 
We were not able to hear from as many people as we should have. 
We were not able to hear from them in a context that was constructive and open to real change.  
I see the minister in the House today and I am glad he is here. 
I would like to echo the complimentary, positive attitude of the member who just spoke, but I would find that difficult. 
I do not think the minister and the government have been open, unless I am wrong and I find out later today that they will be open to some amendments. 
They have not been open to building a consensus around the bill that would enable not just Liberals but others to go forward and claim this very important piece of legislation as their own, so that it would be clear that, with the exception of the Conservatives, there was some measure of federalist unity on this issue.  
I have been part of this process before. 
Even Pierre Trudeau, who was noted for his determination and has been called all kinds of things, including arrogant, tried to do things in the early eighties which the NDP felt were important so that he could bring us on side.  
That had been left out. 
What did Pierre Trudeau do? 
That is why we have section 35 today.  
But nothing was learned. 
So far, nothing.  
So even the wisdom of that time, the early eighties, of Mr. Trudeau and others trying to build something that could bring people together, is not for this minister. 
No, he knows everything and the rest of us are just chopped liver, including the aboriginal leadership and everyone else.  
This is constitution making, as it has to do with the possible breakup of the country or how it could be kept together in the event of a referendum, depending on how one looks at it. 
It needs to be approached with a far different spirit and a far different frame of mind from the way in which the current minister has approached it. 
Frankly, he has made it very difficult. 
Maybe that is what he wanted all along.  
He is making it very difficult for myself and others in my caucus who supported the principle of the bill, who supported the idea that there be a legislative implementation or framework established pursuant to the supreme court opinion. 
All of these things we have supported.  
Those are the two easiest amendments for the government. 
We have submitted about six or seven amendments having to do with aboriginal concerns, but the two easiest ones for the government were to simply list aboriginal people along with the provinces, territories and the Senate as people whose views the minister would want to take into account in determining whether there was a clear question and subsequently whether there was a clear majority.  
The government will not do that. 
Why not? 
There is absolutely no good reason for not putting the aboriginal people on that list of people whose views need to be taken into account. 
There is not a person on the other side of the House who could stand up and give me one good reason why those two amendments could not be accepted, except for the unmitigated, titanic, bloody arrogance of that man over there, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs who thinks he knows everything about this country and that the rest of us do not have anything to say.  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe that is unduly provocative and unparliamentary. 
I think it is uncalled for and the member should withdraw what he just said.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I believe that the member has gone overboard slightly this time. 
I will ask him to resume debate but to please choose his words more carefully.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie:
Madam Speaker, I have no intention of apologizing because I did not say anything unparliamentary. 
All I did was speak the truth.  
Further to what I had to say, the government is revealing an attitude toward this place that should concern the government backbenchers. 
They should be concerned about the way their own government is acting.  
Now we have this process. 
All the way along there has been nothing but stonewalling, nothing but a totally closed door and not just to us.  
That is what this bill does. 
That is what makes it so fundamentally unacceptable and regrettable.  
I am here not just in sorrow but also in anger. 
I feel we could have done much better as a parliament. 
We could have done much better as a committee in spite of the fact that we had the kind of obstacles that were put in our way by the Bloc Quebecois. 
The government could have taken St. Paul's advice and tried to overcome evil with good instead of wrong for wrong, arrogance for arrogance, mistake for mistake, contempt for contempt. 
Mr. André Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Having three gag orders on one bill is absolutely incredible. 
That is how the present government operates.  
I will savour these next 10 minutes, because I am not sure whether the government will allow me to speak on behalf of my party for the rest of the session. 
That is how things are going at this time.  
I would like to make two or three brief comments. 
First of all, one to my caucus. 
From the start, four members had decided to support the bill, because everyone agrees that having clarity on the question and on what constitutes a majority might facilitate things.  
I am addressing them. 
I hope that the hon. members are going to see that the way the government is handling this bill is preventing the elected representatives and citizens of this country from being able to really speak out and reflect on this matter. 
I trust that my colleagues are going to see what is going on.  
In a referendum process, after a yes vote of 50% plus one, imagine how we are going to have our cage rattled, how much the few rights remaining to the opposition will be trampled. 
The way the Liberals are handling things now is not a very good sign for the future.  
I trust that our party will be the same as the country on Bill C-20-united.  
I heard what the Reform Party critic had to say. 
Not to be disrespectful of the Reform, but I had a picture in my head. 
The signs says ``kick me''. 
That is the problem with the Reform Party. 
It is so afraid of losing one vote on this issue in western Canada that it is willing to have a sign on its back which says ``Please kick me. 
I will love you anyway. 
I am going to support the bill anyway''.  
There has been closure three times. 
The Reformers say they do not agree with the process, but support the bill nevertheless. 
It makes no sense. 
Such principles are not exactly cast in stone.  
There is my NDP colleague as well, who is in fine fettle today and who said ``It makes no sense the way they are treating the first nations''. 
He is right, but his party will support the bill in any case.  
The member for Mount Royal, the expert on the committee, said to the first nations ``Your message has been clearly heard, we will see there are amendments to have your thoughts taken into account. 
No more, however. 
It will be like the provinces. 
But, what happens if the government does not support the amendment? 
There will be problems with the credibility of the member for Mount Royal, who, in committee, seemed to be speaking for the government. 
But, in addition to that, what is happening with the New Democratic Party's opposition?  
What I would ask my colleagues in the Reform Party is to take off the sign that says ``kick me'' and say it makes no sense.  
I say to our NDP colleagues that we will be pleased to support their first nations amendment. 
Our amendments were rejected for the most part, in any case. 
We wanted clarity amendments. 
We proposed clarity amendments and they were rejected in the process.  
Do you know what amendments we moved? 
We proposed inclusion of the words province of Quebec and National Assembly in the bill. 
During his whole testimony, he said how evil the sovereignists and the Progressive Conservatives of Quebec were. 
The government says ``This bill is about clarity''. 
We want to help it make things even clearer. 
The title of the bill refers to Quebec, the preamble refers to Quebec and the minister, the Prime Minister and witnesses spoke of Quebec but the bill itself does not mention Quebec. 
The word Quebec does not appear one single time in the text of the bill. 
Why? 
Because they were too afraid. 
The sensitivities of Quebecers could put the federal government at risk in the future. 
As a principle, it is rather feeble.  
One does not run a country with a baseball bat. 
That is not the way this country should function. 
I believe there should be much more openness. 
Canadians should be very concerned about the way this government is dealing with this bill. 
Why? 
So that the Prime Minister may say next weekend ``We got it. 
Now, here is the good news: thanks to the wonderful work of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, of Cabinet and of the Liberal Party caucus and thanks to my political instinct, if you want to break the country, you will need to ask a clear question and to obtain a clear majority''.  
It is a rather feeble excuse. 
They are happy, the country is saved. 
He said that no matter what the question was, for example the question used in 1995 or in 1980, with a result of 50% plus one- You are now entering a new world.  
He said ``Whether there is any legislation or not, you are in a new political, economic and legal world''.  
The legislation can be improved as much as they want, what will happen with a result of 50% plus one on a question like the one used in 1995 and 1980, will be something new. 
It is certainly not Bill C-20 that will solve everything, on the contrary. 
It prevents us from finding solutions or alternatives. 
We are stuck with a table of contents, a modus operandi. 
And they call that flexibility.  
The ambiguity Mr. Clark was talking about is the same ambiguity that we were faced with when Mr. Trudeau said, back in 1980 ``If you vote no, it means yes''. 
Now that is ambiguity. 
As far as flexibility is concerned, it remains to be seen.  
I urge all the opposition parties and my colleagues in the Conservative caucus to stand up and to stand united as we want the country to be.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Madam Speaker, you will appreciate that I was anxious to take part in this debate. 
We are not pleased, however, to have to speak to such an issue, to a bill on clarity which, I must say, does not provide any.  
Instead, the bill before us creates confusion. 
It is unreasonable and undemocratic. 
It fails to respect the letter and the spirit of the opinion provided by the supreme court at the request of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
The Bloc Quebecois certainly moved many amendments, but when the government wants to introduce a bill on clarity, it must be clear.  
Let me read an amendment that I moved and which is part of Group No. 1. 
We were asking, in Motion No. 2, that Bill C-20, in the preamble, be amended by adding, before line 1 on page 1, the following-and this is very important. 
You will understand later: 
Whereas when the Quebec people were consulted by a referendum in 1995, the winning choice was the one that obtained a majority of the votes declared valid, that is, fifty percent of the votes plus one vote; 
The people on the other side won last time. 
If they participated and are still here, it is because we are democrats and we respect the result of the votes. 
But they are scared of the results, perhaps because the results were tight that time.  
What did the government promise to us before the referendum? 
That it would recognize the distinctiveness of Quebecers. 
That was in the speech delivered in Verdun. 
We have already gone further. 
What about this declaration? 
The Prime Minister wasted no time in pushing through this House a motion on distinct society.  
You are the Chair. 
A motion is not as powerful as legislation. 
When they want to tell Quebecers that they love them, they use a motion. 
It is barely worth the paper it is written on. 
When they want to clobber Quebecers, they use legislation. 
I am not inventing this. 
We have a bill before us.  
I would also like to add to the four adjectives I used earlier an explanation on how this bill is confusing. 
It has to do with the arbitrary criteria the minister is trying to include. 
He wants to reserve the right to decide whether the question is clear.  
You have visited all of Canada and know that some expressions used in eastern Canada are meaningless in western or central Canada. 
For example, there is one we often use in Quebec when it rains. 
We say that it is raining nails, whereas in English they say that it is raining cats and dogs.  
The last time, the Prime Minister understood, but now he is not quite sure. 
The day before the referendum he said ``To remain Canadian or not, to stay or to leave, that is the issue of the referendum''. 
If even he could understand the question, it means that the question was clear. 
Why should we waste the time of the House in a debate like this? 
During this time, the economic issues in this country are being ignored. 
In the finance minister's last budget, we do not find a single word about areas like mine which are hurting.  
What they need is money to boost their economy. 
However, we never talk about that in the House. 
I would like the House to discuss reasonable initiatives, and give resources to people in our ridings.  
This bill is unreasonable because it gives the federal government plenty of reasons to prevent any negotiation from taking place. 
When we joined confederation, there was no referendum. 
The fathers of confederation made that decision among themselves. 
However, the surprising thing is that, when more provinces joined the federation, we were never asked for our permission. 
We are nice chaps, we did not object in any way.  
People in my riding are fed up with such a government. 
The bill is unreasonable because it also prevents Quebec from offering a partnership to Canada. 
They want us to look like the bad guys while they take away all the furniture including the kitchen sink. 
We want to be able to make the decisions concerning our future by ourselves, including the decision to say that we would have a brighter future outside of Canada. 
Every time we want to improve on things, we are gagged.  
The bill is unreasonable also because it is contrary to the position of all political parties in Quebec. 
Even Jean Charest, the saviour, a former member of this House who was sent to Quebec, does not approve of Bill C-20. Quebec's consensus should be taken into account.  
The bill is undemocratic because it subordinates the democratic will of the Quebec people to the will of the rest of Canada. 
It is our future. 
Let us decide by ourselves what we want. 
The bill is undemocratic also because the federal government is appropriating the right to reject the vote of Quebecers. 
The bill will give more weight to a federalist vote than to a sovereigntist vote.  
The bill does not respect the letter and spirit of the supreme court opinion. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has made up requirements that are not mentioned in that opinion.  
The bill does not respect the letter and spirit of the supreme court opinion because the government chose what it liked in that opinion and threw away all other democratic considerations. 
What this bill proposes is unilateral action when the supreme court condemned such a course of action.  
In its opinion, the court insisted on the need to negotiate when the bill is geared to prevent any negotiation. 
I move: 
That the French text of Motion No. 9 be amended by adding the word ``un'' after the word ``donné'' 
As many members have said, after being gagged, censured and subjected to time allocation, as the member for Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, I will have had only 10 minutes to speak to a bill that could have an impact on the future of Quebec and of my fellow citizens. 
It is not normal that we were given only 10 minutes. 
If they want to claim to be great democrats, they should let people express themselves.  
I understand that this is not the Chair's fault. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is with great honour that I enter the debate today. 
What we are discussing is very important. 
It seems to underpin the very democratic process not only of parliament, but of the Canadian way in terms of how we do things and the importance of what it means to act in a democratic fashion.  
I listened with great interest to the Reform Party and the member for Macleod. 
The one thing with which I agreed was his congratulations to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
The minister has done a tremendous job in this whole process and deserves our congratulations, respect and thanks. 
I listed too to the NDP and the member for Winnipeg-Transcona. 
He got a little outraged and put on a little theatre for us in the House. 
Really what he did was quite trite. 
I assume he knows his constitutional history but he certainly did not show it today. 
I say to him and all Canadians, that process is in place and in hand and we will do it in a manner consistent with the values- 
Mr. Peter Stoffer:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If the hon. member would understand the facts of what the member for Winnipeg-Transcona said- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is debate. 
That is not a point of order.  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Madam Speaker, I will tell you what I am saying. 
It astonished me, and the member reminds me of what the leader of the NDP did when we first brought in the clarity bill. 
Outside she was quoted as saying that the bill was stupid and provocative. 
Those were exactly her words. 
I find it shameful that the NDP would take that kind of attitude on such an important bill, the clarity bill which underpins the very importance of not only who we are but what we represent.  
I say to my hon. colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party opposite, the party of Sir John A. Macdonald and Cartier, imagine how they would be spinning in their graves. 
Imagine how they are today listening to the Progressive Conservatives not standing up for Canada, not being on the right side of history, being on the wrong side of history, and their leader Joe Clark saying the kind of nonsense he has been saying with respect to this all important bill. 
It is shameful that the party of Sir John A. and the party of Cartier has come to that. 
It is absolutely disgraceful.  
I had to give my head a shake to really understand what the Bloc member who spoke before me was trying to say. 
Imagine having to bring in an amendment to an amendment. 
Imagine threatening, as Bloc members have now done, a thousand amendments on three clauses. 
Imagine getting up day after day in the House of Commons, in this great place of democracy, and reading 300 press clippings and always caterwauling away. 
They say they represent the democrats when in fact it is quite the opposite. 
But what do they do? 
They keep stalling. 
Even at the committee they went on for five hours to try to talk it out so that the business of the committee could not take place. 
Imagine the disgrace and the shame. 
I cannot believe that they- 
The Speaker:
Order, please. 
The hon. member has at least five minutes left to speak, but it is 2 o'clock and we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
COMMONWEALTH DAY 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I invite Canadians to celebrate Commonwealth Day, remembering our shared heritage and ready to work together to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.  
This year's theme, the communications challenge, is highly appropriate at the start of the new millennium. 
Recent advances in communications technology bring the challenge of ensuring that the advantages of modern communications are available to all and that they are used to bring us closer together.  
Just a few months ago the Commonwealth held its heads of government meeting in a democratic South Africa. 
There leaders praised the role that the Commonwealth played in bringing an end to apartheid. 
Nigeria, fresh from its own elections, also expressed its gratitude for the Commonwealth's efforts to restore democracy there.  
Clearly the Commonwealth is making a positive contribution in the world today.  
* * * 
RELIGION 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, last Thursday protesters vandalized the Mary Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal. 
They were yelling against religion, spray painting and defacing the cathedral, and overturning the tabernacle and ripping up hymn books.  
Seven people have been charged with unlawful assembly, assault against police officers and obstruction. 
Hate crime charges were not considered because ``the elements were not there for charges of that kind''.  
A National Post editorial notes: 
What is missing is media and political outrage. 
Anti-Christian hostility is one of the last acceptable bigotries in Canada. 
It is observable not only in the bigots and thugs who attacked the cathedral, but in federal bureaucrats, for example, who instructed Swissair crash site mourners to make no mention of Jesus Christ.  
Where is the outrage?  
* * * 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on March 6 at 10.30 a.m., Dan Doyle of Woodstock, Ontario demonstrated great generosity and selflessness when he jumped between a car and a baby stroller, saving Brenda Craig and her 22 month old son, Barry. 
In the resulting collision, Dan Doyle suffered a fractured leg and rib while the mother and her child were unhurt.  
Police and public alike are calling Mr. Doyle a hero. 
Mr. Doyle's wife commented that his actions did not surprise her as he is always watching out for other people and lending a hand whenever possible.  
We are not often faced with life-threatening situations. 
It is heartening to know that there are some citizens who are not afraid to put themselves in harm's way to save the life of another.  
I am proud to acknowledge the heroism of Dan Doyle. 
Thank you, Dan, for your heroic example.  
* * * 
SENIORS 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Alliance of Seniors to Protect Canada's Social Programs represents 25 organizations with a combined membership of over 500,000 seniors.  
Many seniors who are immigrants are socially isolated due to limited language skills, cultural inhibitions and discrimination. 
This makes accessibility to social programs and services more difficult particularly in the areas of health, community care access, housing and education.  
The Government of Canada and the Alliance of Seniors to Protect Canada's Social Programs recognize the importance of funding for health care, the specific needs of seniors, and the special linguistic and cultural requirements of minority communities.  
We are committed to working with seniors toward programs and services consistent with cultural backgrounds and needs of our diverse and aging population. 
Together we will maintain and enhance Canada's social programs in keeping with Canada's reputation as the best country in the world in which to live.  
* * * 
MINING INDUSTRY 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, RSW-Béroma of Val-d'Or will operate the first small scale mine in the Abitibi, with a modular plant for ore concentration.  
The unique features of this concept, compared to a conventional plant, are its investment costs, its quick installation and its mobility.  
The project is located at the Granada gold deposit, northwest of Val-d'Or, in the Abitibi.  
* * * 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respect to Tara Sloan, one of Canada's top swimmers. 
Ms. Sloan passed on two days ago in Calgary after being involved in a tragic car accident.  
Tara was a five time Canadian breaststroke champion and set the women's 100 metre breaststroke national record in the short course pool. 
She was a great competitor with a passion for life who proudly represented her country at the world championships, the Pan American Games and the Commonwealth Games. 
She won 17 international medals.  
They won the men's and women's overall team titles.  
Today our sympathy and the thoughts and prayers of this House join with those of the family, friends, teammates and competitors of this wonderful young Canadian, Ms. Tara Sloan.  
* * * 
FIGHT AGAINST RACISM 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
We must lead the fight against racism on an individual and collective level.  
We must always appreciate the opportunity that we have to share our values of support and solidarity with cultural communities.  
As individuals, we have a responsibility to apply these values in our daily lives, so that those who settle in Canada feel at home here.  
However, the fight against racism is far from over. 
We must eliminate the resistance that still exists, to ensure that all new Canadians have access to a certain quality of life.  
I call on all governments and organizations to work together to ensure the best possible future for those who decide to come to live in Canada.  
* * * 
BILL C-20 
Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, for the past few days, the government House leader has been suffering from proceduritis, and has been trying to change the rules of Parliament through trickery.  
Not content to have limited the debates on Bill C-20 in committee, and not content to have rammed Bill C-20 through, the specialist in dirty tricks and double-dealing has added insult to injury with Motions Nos. 8 and 9, in order to change the rules of the game in the midst of the debate.  
How shameful, particularly for the Liberal members, who do not want to voice their opinions on Bill C-20. We can understand that the sole intent of the latest trick of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons was to allow his colleagues to avoid their duty as parliamentarians.  
When the voting on Bill C-20 takes place, the people of Quebec will finally know who is prepared to stand up to defend its rights and who is prepared to stand up to defend democracy.  
* * * 
FARM SAFETY 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, with National Farm Safety Week about to end, let us resolve to reduce farm related injuries throughout the year.  
Farming is a way of life for over 200,000 farm families from coast to coast to coast. 
It is also a profession with one of the highest risks of on the job injury and death. 
Close to 700 Canadians died of farm related injuries between 1990 and 1996. 
Most of these could have been prevented. 
Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture along with other farm safety groups are urging farmers to equip their tractors with rollover protection structures and seatbelts. 
That is what National Farm Safety Week is all about, getting farmers and their families thinking about how they can protect themselves from what are often needless injuries on their farms.  
* * * 
CURLING 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of British Columbia I would like to declare that B.C. now stands for ``Best Curlers''.  
Yesterday skip Greg McAulay of New Westminster completed the trillium of champions by capturing his first Brier championship against the formidable Russ Howard.  
British Columbia will be representing Canada at the World Curling Championships in three categories: men's, featuring Greg McAulay's rink of Brent Pierce, Brian Miki, Jody Svestrup and Darin Fenton; women's, featuring Richmond's Kelley Law's rink of Julie Skinner, Georgina Wheatcroft, Diane Nelson and Elaine Dagg-Jackson; and junior men's, featuring Kelowna's Brad Kuhn's team of Kevin Folk, Ryan Kuhn and Hugh Bennett.  
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Saskatoon who organized and supported the Year 2000 Brier, setting a new attendance record.  
Curling has long been one of Canada's favourite sports and now British Columbia leads the way. 
Congratulations and good luck to all at the world championships.  
* * * 
CHIEF JOE MATHIAS 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
I knew Chief Mathias personally. 
He was a man greatly respected by his people, myself and many other people. 
Our blessings are with him and his family.  
* * * 
OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the recent federal budget comes as a major disappointment to Canadians who care about the poorest of the poor in our world.  
The Prime Minister talks big when he travels abroad but under his watch, Canadian overseas development assistance has fallen off dramatically. 
Canada's target was to provide .7 of 1% of the gross national product to foreign assistance. 
Under this government we have slipped back to about one-third of that target and the budget does not improve things.  
The Canadian Council for International Cooperation tells us that we will be spending a smaller and smaller percentage of GNP on foreign assistance through to the year 2003.  
The development needs are enormous in the areas of food, nutrition and agriculture, for basic education and health care, especially for women.  
In the budget the government has lost an opportunity to do something really constructive for the poor and the vulnerable in other countries. 
Canadians are a generous people but the government has not matched their generosity.  
* * * 
THE LATE MARCEL PÉPIN 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on March 6, we lost Marcel Pépin.  
Marcel Pépin left his mark on Quebec and on his era, first as President of the CSN from 1965 to 1976, and then of the World Confederation of Labour. 
After studying under Father Lévesque at Laval University, he went on to contribute greatly to making the CSN, a labour federation that was as combative as it was democratic, the spearhead of the Quiet Revolution.  
The ``society built for man'' which he sought could only come about as the result of a fight to the finish between the workers and all those with power. 
The union movement needed to unite andopen up a second social front in order to constitute a counter-balance to prevent workers from being crushed, dominated and deprived of their voice.  
His texts and moral reviews, containing such sayings as ``There is no more place for Quebec in the present system'' or ``Our own means are all we can count on'' have marked Quebec in general, but have had far more impact on the public sector coalition, which would never have existed without him. 
With his great experience as a negotiator, Marcel Pépin had the knack of obtaining the best settlements, always in favour of the little people above all.  
Thank you, Marcel Pépin.  
* * * 
JOB CREATION IN CANADA 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on March 9, Statistics Canada released encouraging news about Canada's employment situation.  
Based on its labour force survey, Statistics Canada determined that the unemployment rate was at 6.8% in February 1999, the lowest rate since April 1976.  
Moreover, in February, 36,000 new jobs were created, thus continuing a pattern that began three years ago.  
Finally, 1.9 million jobs were created since we came to office, in 1993. 
* * * 
REFUGEES 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I have to commend the people working in these camps, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and all the NGOs, such as Médecins sans frontières, the World Food Organization and all the dedicated church groups.  
I want to thank the Canadian High Commissioner in Nairobi and all of his staff for setting up the details for this very important visit. 
I want to thank our immigration officers and staff in Kenya and London for letting our group sit in during interviews which included the minister of immigration and the member for Mississauga West.  
Last but not least, I want to thank the minister's staff for setting up this on the ground experience of looking at how we determine refugees, immigrants and visitor visas.  
* * * 
JUNO AWARDS 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last night we all celebrated with Canada's best at the 29th annual Juno Awards in Toronto. 
Congratulations to Bryan Adams and Chantal Kreviazuk, for winning best male and female artists of the year.  
Let me congratulate Paul Brandt for winning best country male artist and Shania Twain for best songwriter. 
Let me also congratulate SKY for winning best new group and Sarah McLachlan for winning the international achievement award.  
Canada can be proud of its musical talent and of the recognition it receives from both Canadian and international audiences.  
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in August the human resources department prepared a communication strategy for the minister. 
The aim was to manage the release of an internal audit that pointed to gross mismanagement of taxpayer dollars by the minister. 
The document suggested three options for releasing and communicating the results of that audit: a reactive approach, a low key approach, and a proactive approach. 
Each came with suggested advantages and disadvantages.  
Why did the minister choose the reactive approach as outlined in that communication strategy?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear that the communications plan was a draft. 
It was prepared before the audit was even complete. 
It is usual for departments, particularly communications officials, to prepare this kind of information. 
It was not forwarded to me, nor would I have expected it to have been.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
We have a copy finally of this communications brief. 
It outlines three distinct approaches, going from the most transparent, the proactive approach, to the least transparent, the reactive approach. 
The reactive strategy suggests carrying on business as usual and not releasing the results of the audit until forced to do so by an access to information request.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again let me say that this was a draft report.  
If the hon. member wants to talk about fact, let us look at what we did. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us go over it again. 
The words ``demonstrates transparency'' were only used in connection with one approach, the proactive approach. 
The approach the minister chose was described as simply ``demonstrating business as usual''.  
Again, how can the minister claim she is being transparent when she rejected the one communications approach her own departmental people said- 
The Speaker:
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we came clean with the Canadian public. 
We made the internal audit public. 
We presented to the House 10,000 pages of projects. 
I wonder when members of that party will come clean with the Canadian public and say that they were wrong when they said $3 billion was missing, that they were wrong when they said $1 billion was missing, that they were wrong when they said it was an access to information request- 
Some hon. members:
Hear, hear.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me just tell the minister that we are getting close with all of these investigations going on. 
It will be surprising how much money they actually do come up with.  
I would have thought that with a week away from the House she could have come up with a better strategy than that.  
In August her officials had a plan to release the internal audit. 
They chose three strategies: a transparent one, a semi-transparent one and a hide and seek version. 
The so-called reactive strategy involved the department carrying on business as usual until it got caught.  
Why did the minister choose a ``let us not get caught'' strategy?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where that party has been, but it is me and my department that made this internal audit public. 
It is my department that chose to implement a six point plan that is now making a difference.  
From the point of view of the work of the Human Resources Development Department, we are taking this very seriously. 
We have said that over and over again and I, quite frankly, do not know where these questions are coming from.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you where this party has been. 
We have been filing access to information requests because this minister was not forthcoming.  
Let me also add that the minister continues to say that she came forward with her little six point plan and everything was going to be all right. 
The only reason she made this plan public was because she knew she had been caught in the act.  
Was the minister gambling that this little plan would be uncovered before the next election?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I categorically deny that it was an access to information request that made this report public. 
It is very clear from letters between myself and my deputy that I took this very seriously. 
It is clear that the approach which we have taken is one of transparency and openness.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, HRDC it will be recalled appointed Mr. Champagne, the lawyer of Claude Gauthier, to be trustee of the $1.2 million grant to be paid to the same Claude Gauthier once the Placeteco purchase had been completed. 
In the light of these facts, the minister said job creation was important.  
Accordingly, how can the Minister of Human Resources Development justify the fact that her department's grant to Placeteco was in fact used by its new owner, Claude Gauthier, to pay off a million dollar loan the company had with the National Bank?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me repeat for the umpteenth time that in these transitional jobs fund grants we are but one partner. 
Over and over again it was the Government of Quebec that also accepted and supported these programs.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Human Resources Development Canada and the Government of Canada are administering and managing the funds.  
A trust was set up, contrary to the opinion of Treasury Board. 
The lawyer, Claude Gauthier, acted for the company and for the trust, which seems normal to the minister. 
He is a friend of the Prime Minister and this must be why. 
It is also contrary to Treasury Board directives. 
Using $1 million to not create jobs is irregular and abnormal.  
Could the minister tell us if the reason is not because there was pressure from the Prime Minister's office to help his friends and pay back the National Bank with the money that was supposed to be used to create jobs?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me remind the hon. member yet again that these undertakings were part of a partnership. 
They were community economic development strategies that were supported by the communities themselves, by the private sector, by the Government of Quebec and in some small way by the Government of Canada.  
Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to continue with the Placeteco affair.  
Can the minister tell us whether her department really knows what this $200,000 was used for?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This partnership, which has been agreed to by the local community with the Government of Quebec and with the federal government, is creating jobs for people in a region of high unemployment.  
Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not all that surprised at the minister's response. 
Will the government finally initiate a public and independent inquiry into all of her department's activities, or will she launch a fourth RCMP investigation in the Prime Minister's riding?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again, as part of our undertakings we have implemented a plan that will make a difference.  
I want to remind the hon. member that the auditor general will be completing a full review of grants and contributions in the Department of Human Resources Development Canada. 
As an arm's length agent of this body, I am sure the hon. member would appreciate that he is the one who can best review and advise in this regard.

HEALTH CARE 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Why will the current health minister not just oppose Alberta's health privatization law clearly and unequivocally? 
What is he waiting for?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, we are looking at the legislation-and, indeed, I would like to see the regulations as well-to determine whether it complies with the Canada Health Act. 
Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. 
Rome is burning, health is in crisis, and the minister continues to fiddle.  
Canadians do not want a two tier health system. 
Nor do they want Americans to play doctor with their health. 
That is clear.  
Is the minister going to follow the advice of his predecessors? 
Is he going to clearly oppose privatization in Alberta?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what I find puzzling is why the New Democratic Party will not join with us in the work we are doing to renew medicare within the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
What the NDP governments of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and B.C. and the federal NDP are doing instead are playing into the hands of the Reform Party, those on the right who do not want the Canada Health Act. 
The real enemies of medicare are over there on the right in the Reform Party. 
If they think those people are bad, wait until they hear the views of Stockwell Day on the subject.

HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, for months questions concerning the unprecedented mismanagement of millions of taxpayer dollars have gone unanswered in the House. 
The minister and Prime Minister have taken pains to minimize the enormous case of fiscal irresponsibility.  
Almost daily now we have been advised of more RCMP investigations. 
We know of at least 19 grants now currently under investigation, three in the Prime Minister's riding, and one where charges have been laid.  
Will the minister now restore some faith in her department by disclosing the full number of grants which she is aware of that are under investigation, active, completed or pending?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been as transparent as is appropriate to the House with regard to this particular issue.  
* * * 
INDIAN AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is so transparent, we can see right through her.  
We know that there is systemic mismanagement present in other government departments, such as CIDA and now Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
In 1971 the Prime Minister was the minister of Indian affairs and he stated: 
-we cannot spend millions of dollars without developing some criteria and rules for the administration of those moneys.  
And yet, in an audit released while parliament was not sitting, as expected, why is the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development still doling out money to native chiefs if they are refusing to account for their spending?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the policy and it is not what we are doing.  
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the human resources minister told the House on February 7: ``I am not trying to hide anything. 
I made the report public''.  
But new documents show the truth. 
Last fall the minister deliberately chose not to make the audit public unless she was forced to do so. 
How can the minister square her claim to transparency with her choice of the so-called reactive strategy?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I counter it with fact.  
The fact is, it is our department that made the audit public. 
The fact is, it is our department that has provided over 10,000 pages of information to members of the House.  
We have gone well beyond the most proactive strategy suggested in what the hon. member is referring to. 
Quite frankly, that was only a draft report.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that this so-called draft report was an extensive plan which showed that in August the department was ready, willing and able to release the audit.  
Even the minister admits that she was finally clued in in November, but it was only after an opposition access request in January that the virtues of transparency suddenly became apparent to the minister.  
Why did she stick to the strategy of hiding the audit as long as she could?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject everything that the hon. member has said. 
Her thesis is completely wrong.  
I had the pleasure of going to Calgary last week and visiting some very important projects which received grants and contributions in the member's own backyard: programs to get young prostitutes off the street, programs to help young people who have not had the chance to get a full time job to get a job.  
Perhaps since the hon. member will not go to visit those programs she would come to my riding. 
She would understand then why Mr. Marshall of Duchess Foods said: ``I believe the attack of the Reform Party is strictly based on political considerations and not-'' 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for Québec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Claude Gauthier, the owner of Placeteco, told an official he did not need to account to Human Resources Development Canada on what he did with the $1.2 million grant.  
What measures has the minister taken to get Claude Gauthier to account not to the National Bank, not to lawyer Champagne, not to the office of the Prime Minister, but to the Department of Human Resources Development?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reviewed these projects on a number of occasions in the House.  
I reiterate that these projects have created employment for people in areas of high unemployment. 
I reiterate that the Government of Canada is but one partner in these projects and that it was strongly supported by its kissing cousins in the Government of Quebec. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, under Treasury Board rules, once Placeteco came under the protection of the Bankruptcy Act, the $1.2 million grant should have been returned to Human Resources Development Canada, and not put in trust.  
How does the minister justify the grant to Claude Gauthier being considered an inheritance rightly going to the new owner, who bought Placeteco for a dollar?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again in the House we talked about the issue of the trust funds. 
I made it clear that there was an inappropriate administrative strategy undertaken by my department. 
Those trust funds were closed. 
The programs are still functioning and people are working.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Now this rot has spread to ACOA, Indian affairs and CIDA. 
Today there are 19 separate police investigations, three in the Prime Minister's riding alone, all over a missing $251.50.  
That is the government's story. 
Is it sticking to it?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, speaking of stories, the hon. member ought to get his story straight because he is totally wrong in what he is asserting.  
He was talking about the information he had at that time when he spoke about money that needed to be recovered. 
He was totally correct when he spoke of $259, based on the reviews that had been carried out, until that point, of the 37 cases.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There are now 19- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Speaker:
Order, please. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg:
Mr. Speaker, there are now 19 police investigations, three in the Prime Minister's riding. 
The minister says she wants to be transparent. 
Here is her chance. 
My question for the minister is:
How many police investigations are under way, how many have already taken place and how many are pending?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, with reference to the Department of Human Resources Development Canada, I have been forthcoming with this House. 
Other than the press release that was issued by my department last Monday, things are as they have been.  
* * * 
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Now, the revenue minister recently suggested that CINAR might be able to avail itself of the voluntary disclosure program.  
Will the Minister of National Revenue, who is surely aware of the sanctity of copyright and will therefore want to prevent this whole matter from being discreetly stifled, pledge to ensure that CINAR cannot avail itself of the voluntary disclosure program?  
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago, when I was asked about this issue, I said that when we are referring to a specific case, namely CINAR, we must respect the fundamental principle of Canadian taxation. 
The file at Revenue Canada-and this is important for all taxpayers-is a confidential file.  
As for the issue of voluntary disclosure, there is indeed a voluntary disclosure program at Revenue Canada. 
As suggested by its title, disclosure must be voluntary. 
I invite opposition members to contact the department for more information on what is a voluntary disclosure. 
They will find out.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
I will therefore direct my supplementary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Given the scope of incriminating facts that keep accumulating in the CINAR affair, what is the minister waiting for to order a public, independent inquiry?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, under access to information we received an extensive communications plan developed by HRDC to handle the release of the internal audit on the billion dollar boondoggle. 
It includes strategic considerations, story lines, media strategies and timelines. 
It was dated August 30, 1999. 
After a week off to consider the facts, why is the minister still spinning the same story?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, because our story is the truth.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Does the minister honestly expect us to believe that she only learned about this audit on November 17, as she stated in the House?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us review the facts again. 
This was a draft communications plan. 
It is normal for the communications officials in a department to prepare communication strategies.  
This was being prepared and the audit was not even completed. 
It was not forwarded to me and, as I have said earlier, I would not have expected it to be.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on March 3, the Minister of Human Resources Development received the report she had commissioned from a Toronto firm in the matter of the redirecting of a grant from the riding of Rosemont to the riding of the Prime Minister.  
How can the minister, who boasts of her clarity in this matter, continue to refuse to make public this investigation, which was paid for by the public and out of the public purse?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes reference to the Rosemont files. 
As he knows, on Monday last the department issued a press release saying that this had been referred to the RCMP. 
As such, the questions would be presented to them.  
* * * 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
The floods in Mozambique have taken their horrific toll in recent weeks and now we have reports that heavy rains and mudslides have displaced land mines in what is already one of the most heavily land mined countries in the world.  
What is Canada doing about this threat to the lives of so many distressed people?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore for raising this very crucial issue in the House.  
It is absolutely true that added to the enormous suffering which the people of Mozambique have experienced is the new danger caused by the dislodgement of thousands of land mines which had previously been demarcated or carefully mapped. 
What we now face is an urgent request from the Mozambique Mine Action Centre for help.  
I am pleased to announce today, with the co-operation of the Minister of National Defence and the Minister for International Cooperation, that we are the first country to respond by adding half a million dollars to the already $12 million we put into mine action programs in Mozambique.  
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I quote from a letter from the deputy minister of human resources which says ``Since June, when the interim audit report became available, we have devoted intensive and sustained management attention to this file''.  
The minister claims that she was completely ignorant about the interim audit, but we have to wonder what she thought everyone in her department was actually doing during this period of ``intensive and sustained management attention''. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, when I received the results of the internal audit, without question I took them seriously. 
I advised the department to strengthen its management report and when the whole audit was completed we made it public.  
The six point plan that we are now implementing, which has had the benefit of advice from the auditor general, from outside third parties, is being implemented. 
I have had the pleasure of going to talk with departmental officials in Calgary and Toronto and in other parts of the country and they are doing their job.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, they may be doing their job, but it is the minister we are asking about.  
The communications plan and the strategy were ready to go in August, but the minister waited until January to release the information on the audit and only after she received an access to information request. 
We have been giving the minister the benefit of the doubt. 
We thought she was simply not up to the job, but now we see something even worse. 
It appears she followed a plan down to a t , which was to hunker down, batten down the hatches and hope that no one asked about the audit until it was old news.  
Why did she try to hide the fact that she mismanaged $1 billion in her department? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member cared to pay attention he would know that even the data collection for the audit was not completed until the early part of the fall. 
He would understand in the course of an internal audit that once the data is collected the management team has to prepare the response. 
He would understand that as minister, when I received this information, I took it seriously and I said that the management response was not strong enough. 
It was strengthened and when the whole report was completed we chose to make it public.  
* * * 
HEALTH CARE 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is now day 10 since Ralph Klein launched the most concerted and comprehensive attack on medicare in the history of this country and the health minister says he is still studying it. 
He says that they do not know what they are going to do at this point.  
One thing we do know is that this government paved the way for privatization by signing a secret 12 point deal with Alberta in 1996, and went so far as to fire a former health minister for trying to stop the deal.  
The minister says he does not know what to do, but today he can start by rescinding the deal and saying no to Ralph Klein. 
Will he do that?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We do not believe that private for profit hospitals are going to help. 
The experience so far is that they have longer waiting lists and higher costs and there are real questions about quality.  
I would like to know why will the NDP not join in the effort to renew medicare instead of aligning itself with those who would destroy it?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, first of all it is unbelievable that the government after 10 days is in no position yet to say no to Ralph Klein and the destruction of medicare. 
It is unbelievable that he pretends that a deal his government signed in 1996 does not exist when in fact section 11 of that deal is the forerunner to Bill 11 now before the Alberta legislature.  
If the government is serious about doing something about medicare, it would rescind its own deal and say absolutely no to Ralph Klein. 
Will the minister do it?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is unalloyed nonsense. 
There is no deal between governments. 
There are principles that the Alberta government proclaimed. 
They will not stand in the way of the enforcement of the Canada Health Act. 
The real issue is why is the NDP the defender of the status quo? 
We want to work to renew medicare. 
It thinks that simply pouring billions into the old system will work. 
It will not. 
Why does it not join with us toward constructive change?  
* * * 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, spring is just around the corner and right now many farmers are trying to find cash to put the crop in. 
Many of them are not being very successful.  
The AIDA program has been like a mirage to a dying person. 
Right now, today, only $500 million of that money has been distributed and put into farmers' pockets.  
Will the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food stand today and admit that he has failed Canadian farmers for the 2000 crop year?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the slow learners come from that side of the House. 
Only $500 million has found its way to farmers' pockets. 
The crop has to go in this spring.  
Of the $500 million that has been distributed, $35 million went to administer the program. 
Can the minister tell me why bureaucrats and bean counters can get their money that quickly but not our farmers?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The rest of them obviously have chosen to wait until they finish their business year, their book work and paperwork as a result of the 1999 business year and submit that. 
I can assure the hon. member that as soon as they do submit those, we will deal with those forms very quickly.  
* * * 
HEALTH CARE 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in this year's budget the Government of Canada committed a further $2.5 billion of health care transfers to the provinces. 
However some of the provincial premiers have suggested that the government is not doing its fair share.  
Can the Minister of Health confirm to the House and to all Canadians the actual level of financial support provided to our health care system?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, over the last four budgets transfers to the provinces for health have increased. 
Some $20 billion of $60 billion is from Ottawa.  
The truth is that of all public health spending in Canada this year, fully one-third is contributed by the Government of Canada.  
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have learned that a sock company in Quebec received $8.1 million under the transitional jobs fund in 1997. 
This is more than what the entire province of Manitoba received, yet the Minister of Human Resources Development stands up in the House and says the program was about creating jobs in a fair manner.  
When will the minister stop socking it to the Canadian taxpayers and step down?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me again give the hon. member the real facts. 
Indeed with Bas Iris the original plan was to be worth $8.1 million but because of production losses the moneys that were transferred were $5.9 million. 
In fact 1,400 jobs were created, not only 1,400 jobs but an additional 40 jobs. 
This has been an important industrial, economic and social advantage to the area.  
* * * 
PUBLIC WORKS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Public Works Canada agreed to transfer a building to Inter-Loge, a community group working in the field of social housing in my riding.  
The department was to completely clean up the site and is now demanding that Inter-Loge finish the task at its own expense, which it cannot afford to do. 
So now, the department is threatening to take back the building and cause the group to lose its deposit of $62,000.  
I would ask the Minister of Public Works to tell us what is happening in this matter and whether he has taken steps to protect Inter-Loge from losing its deposit.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would begin by telling the leader of the Bloc that there is no question of Inter-Loge's losing its deposit. 
In the meantime, I have asked my officials to continue negotiations, see if an agreement can be reached and come up with a solution to this problem. 
The problem is complex because the environmental impact is bigger than we first thought. 
So the situation needs to be reassessed, but already good- 
The Speaker:
The member for Acadie-Bathurst.

GASOLINE PRICES 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the price of gasoline is at a ten-year high, and this is bad for Canada's truckers and for Canadians in general. 
On Friday, the Minister of Labour asked her colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, to do away with the federal tax on fuel.  
Is the Minister of Natural Resources going to heed his colleague and all of the people of Canada and show some leadership in connection with the oil crisis?  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, with respect to the issue of gasoline pricing, obviously any issue related to taxation would need to be referred to the Minister of Finance.  
I think it would be important for the petroleum industry to take note of the level of public concern and to be very transparent in its pricing practices including the price of crude oil, the price for refining, processing, wholesaling, retailing and taxes. 
I think the public is entitled to know when those prices change, exactly by how much and why.  
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is not for the RCMP but for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
In 1995, there was an agreement between Alcan, its labour unions, and the provincial and federal governments. 
In recent months, the federal government has decided to withdraw from the program, while we are well aware that hundreds of jobs have been created and the government is getting its money back in taxes.  
I am asking the minister why, since this is a worthwhile investment, she has pulled out of the partnership program with Alcan and its unionized workers.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will take the hon. member's question under advisement and apprise him of a response.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, twice today the human resources minister told this House that she made the audit public when it was completed. 
How does this square with the facts?  
The interim audit was available in June. 
The Liberals breathed not a word of its explosive contents. 
The audit was formally signed off in October. 
She asked the PCs to destroy that evidence. 
We asked for the audit in January and finally she becomes transparent. 
How can she stand and tell Canadians- 
The Speaker:
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I must categorically reject the assertions of the hon. member. 
Perhaps if instead of reading interim draft reports members would read the final report, they would see that we have taken this audit seriously. 
They would see that we have a plan of action that is working. 
We are training our employees. 
We have got a national auditing structure that is going office by office and monitoring reports- 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for Davenport.

THE ENVIRONMENT 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, from a recent publication by the Department of Natural Resources we learn that the fossil fuel industry's greenhouse gas emissions are increasing dramatically and will have grown by 64% by the year 2010.  
Can the Minister of Natural Resources inform the House when Canada's national strategy will be ready and what he intends to do about the fossil fuel industry's skyrocketing emissions?  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):

HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Last week, the Prime Minister was in his riding. 
Since then, everyone claims that he is as pure as the driven snow, even though the RCMP is conducting at least three investigations in his riding.  
Out of solidarity with the Prime Minister, who seems to be in deep trouble with this scandal, should the minister not immediately order an independent public inquiry to protect him from his political buddies in his riding?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I would remind the hon. member that the auditor general will be doing a study, a review, of the grants and contributions in my department. 
I look forward to his recommendations.  
* * * 
POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, even the banks have walked away from the Canada student loans program because even they recognize the mess of huge debts facing students. 
Students are cheering that news. 
But the bad news is unless the government addresses the root causes of this crisis, debt loads will still be enormous.  
Will the minister now commit to work with the provinces to lower dangerously high tuition fees by restoring public funding that put them up in the first place? 
Will the minister do that?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I would remind the hon. member that as of the most recent budget two weeks ago, an additional $2.5 billion has been made available to the provinces for health care and education.  
* * * 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the minister would want to pause for a moment before answering me. 
Does she realize that she said no to a project that was profitable to the government, which was recovering its investment through the creation of tens of jobs?  
Does the minister agree with the principle of work sharing in plants throughout the country, particularly in outlying regions?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again as I said earlier, I will look into this project and provide an undertaking to the member.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the human resources minister should have one more opportunity to explain why an audit which her department had a whole plan to release at the end of August in fact was not released until after an opposition access request in January. 
How does that square with her claim of transparency? 
I invite the minister to explain that.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say again to the hon. member that there was no access to information that forced us to make the audit public.  
I want to say that I have resented personally the accusations that the member has made against me, calling me a liar outside of the House, because she is wrong.

PRIVILEGE 
LEGISLATIVE SERVICES 
The Speaker:
I have notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Surrey North. 
I read what he sent to me today. 
I know he was busy this morning, but I rendered a decision on a similar case. 
Did he have occasion to hear what the decision was that I gave this morning? 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Yes, I did, Mr. Speaker. 
The Speaker:
Are you still going to raise a question of privilege?  
Mr. Chuck Cadman:
Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
As you know, I provided you with notice on March 3 of this question of privilege. 
While my notice detailed much of the concern, I believe that it is only appropriate that I outline the issue in the House so that all members will be aware of the present situation, as we are all equally affected by these recent events.  
I believe this question of privilege is related to one similar, which was heard by the Speaker in October 1997. 
I say related because the breach of my privileges as a member of parliament has also arisen over the functions of our legislative drafters.  
In 1997 you ruled that the matter be resolved by the Board of Internal Economy. 
My issue does not concern the administrative matters, such as the number of legislative drafters available to assist us in our work, and it does not concern just who is assigned to assist us in drafting legislation. 
My question of privilege has solely to do with solicitor-client privilege and breach of confidentiality.  
First, I will relate the facts of the case. 
Over the past number of weeks I have been dealing with our legislative drafters on a number of amendments to legislation presently before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
The drafting of legislation is one of the most important aspects of this place. 
It is imperative that confidentiality of information be maintained until each member decides to make his or her work public by introducing it either in committee or here at report stage.  
Mr. Speaker, you can imagine my surprise and outrage when I learned from the clerk of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights that he was in possession of my amendments before I had even decided which of them I would be introducing at committee.  
I was informed that it has now been decided that solicitor-client privilege does not attach itself to work completed by our legislative drafters and that the material will be made available to the clerks.  
I do not know who else will have access to this work. 
I do know that the clerk did seek my permission to release my proposed amendments to the Department of Justice lawyers. 
I denied him the permission to release them to anyone.  
Let me make it clear that I do not call into question the integrity of the clerk of the committee, but if he was able to gain possession of my amendments, who else has them?  
It was my understanding that members of parliament are operating with our legislative drafters in a solicitor-client relationship. 
These drafters are lawyers who have been tasked by the House as a whole to assist members in their legislative initiatives.  
It is a competitive market in this place for political reasons, for representing our constituents and for ensuring that our laws effectively achieve what we as individuals perceive to be in the best interests of the country.  
You will remember, Mr. Speaker, how concerned members from all political stripes became in October 1997 when the issue was raised over the lack of sufficient and proper resources to provide members with adequate legislative assistance. 
As I have stated, my concern today is not an administrative function. 
It goes to the essence of the relationship between our lawyers and ourselves to fulfil our duties as members of parliament. 
These lawyers work for us both on private members' legislation and on amendments to government and Senate legislation. 
Without protection of confidentiality, our parliamentary work is severely impacted. 
We become disempowered from carrying out our duties.  
This work was released to others without my consent, which I believe is necessary under the law. 
Legislative counsel come under the precinct of the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
It is my understanding that they have been ordered to release this information contrary to the protection of the solicitor-client privilege.  
It must be addressed. 
Should you find that a prima facie case of privilege exists, Mr. Speaker, and with your permission, I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion.  
The Speaker:
If I understand the hon. member correctly, what he is saying is that there has been a breach of confidentiality because the clerk of the committee had the information.  
I invite the hon. member to review my ruling of this morning. 
With all due respect, I would suggest to him that the clerk of the committee is a member of the team that has to work together so that members can be served.  
If the hon. member is saying that someone other than a person on the team that I described this morning has access to the information, I would like to know about it. 
But the team itself, the drafters, the lawyers, the people who put it into the information system, they are all part of that group. 
As for anyone outside that group, if the hon. member is alleging that someone else had that information, then I would like to hear more about it.  
I would like to review everything the hon. member has said today. 
I would like to let this matter sit at this point, unless someone has something to offer which is in addition to what the hon. member has said.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, with respect, I think the point is something a bit different from a team and who in the team has access to certain information.  
The point is solicitor-client privilege. 
The point is whether we are entitled to rely on legislative counsel to work for us in a privileged way. 
In other words, nobody else knows what we are discussing, what we are planning or what we are doing because these lawyers are giving us advice solely for our own purposes.  
If the clerks are getting this information, then it is on the instructions of someone, Mr. Speaker, and that someone clearly is not us, the members. 
That someone clearly is directing legislative counsel to give information without our knowledge and consent. 
In other words, these legislative counsel do not work for us.  
This even goes beyond solicitor-client privilege because if legislative counsel are getting instructions and are following orders from someone besides us, then how can we be confident that they are doing their greatest and best work for us if their responsibility is to someone else? 
This is very serious, Mr. Speaker. 
The Speaker:
The hon. member reiterates a point that was brought up earlier. 
It has been our tradition since the beginning. 
I would invite the hon. member to please have a look at my ruling of this morning to understand why we arrived at this decision.

POINTS OF ORDER 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, Bloc Quebecois):
Mr. Speaker, I must inform you of an important decision that has been reached by the members of the Bloc Quebecois, in connection with this morning's decision.  
We would have preferred not to have been forced to such a decision, and I mean that most sincerely. 
It is a matter of confidence. 
In the next few minutes, therefore, I shall be introducing a motion of censure of the Speaker of the House, which reads as follows.  
That this House resolve that it no longer has confidence in the Speaker, since it is of the opinion that the Speaker exhibited partiality in determining that the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis on Wednesday, March 1, 2000 was out of order and in rejecting the point of order raised by the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry, to the detriment of the rights and privileges of all of the members of this House.  
I shall be tabling this motion in the next few minutes. 
I would have preferred not to have had to do so. 
However, as I said, our rights and our privileges are at stake, and so is democracy and the confidence everyone must have in the Chair.  
The Speaker:
This is the first time in a long while that the Speaker has had to deal with such a motion. 
The motion is out of order at this time. 
The hon. member must give notice. 
He may do so at his leisure.  
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):

* * * 
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP) moved for leave to introduce Bill C-450, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act. 
I have never agreed that a member of parliament can just up and leave a party and right in the middle of a term join another political party. 
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
* * * 
PETITIONS 
YUGOSLAVIA 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
HIGHWAYS 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is one that I can wholly support. 
It calls on parliament to provide more funding for the national highway system in the 2000 budget. 
I certainly think they are going in the right direction in asking the government to provide more funding for the highways program.  
PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I present 277 signed ribbons from the annual white ribbon against pornography campaign. 
The Deputy Speaker:
I assumed the hon. member was presenting a petition and not ribbons to the House. 
I hope it was a slip of words in his description because of course ribbons would not be in order.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to present four petitions today.  
The first one is a very important petition with several hundred signatures from members of my riding. 
It says that whereas the majority of Canadians consider unborn babies to be worthy of protection and whereas Action Canada for Population- 
The Deputy Speaker:
Order. 
I know the hon. member will want to comply with the rules and summarize the petition rather than read it. 
I sense that we are hearing it read.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, the petitioners pray that the federal government will not continue to have ACPD, a non-government organization that came directly out of the Planned Parenthood Federation of Canada play a leading role in future government sponsored forums on the national and international scene.  
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in the second petition the petitioners pray that parliament use the section 33 notwithstanding clause if necessary concerning the child pornography decision that is coming down very shortly from the Supreme Court of Canada.  
REFUGEES 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in the third petition several hundred petitioners are concerned about mismanagement by the immigration department. 
They pray that legislation will be enacted requiring refugee claimants to demonstrate through identification and documentation very clearly that they are fleeing general political persecution and failing to do that face immediate deportation without delay.  
PENSIONS 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the last petition contains several hundred signatures of people who are really upset with the way the government has scooped the pension plan surpluses from the RCMP, the military and crown corporation agencies. 
They pray that treasury board halt its unilateral appropriation of the surpluses in the public service, military and RCMP pension plans. 
It destroys the morale, the work ethic and confidence in the government.  
MAMMOGRAPHY 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to present a petition duly certified by the clerk of petitions on the subject of breast cancer. 
BILL C-20 
Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to table one of the petitions given to me in the last couple of days by people of my riding.  
This petition concerns Bill C-20. The petitioners are calling for the withdrawal of this bill, which violates the rights of the Quebec people to decide their own future. 
I therefore table this petition.  
CHILD POVERTY 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present petitions from the constituents in my riding of Kitchener Centre.  
The first set urges parliament to fulfill the 1989 promise to end child poverty by the year 2000. 
The petitions have been signed by the residents of the Kitchener-Waterloo area and the members of Rockway Mennonite Church. 
Campaign 2000 has also provided me with a copy of its petition calling on parliament to end child poverty.  
IMMIGRATION TAXES 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the final petition is from the Mennonite Coalition for Refugee Support. 
They call on the House to immediately rescind immigration taxes on refugees and immigrants.  
MARRIAGE 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am presenting petitions with approximately 1,000 names of people across the country including from Langley, Winnipeg and Saskatchewan. They are petitioning that the House respect the motion of nine months ago in defence of and to uphold marriage.  
They are petitioning that in light of the fact that the Prime Minister has limited debate on Bill C-23 and has not allowed a free vote, that the House withdraw Bill C-23 and instead affirm the opposite sex definition of marriage in legislation and ensure that marriage is recognized as a unique institution both in name and policy.  
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions for you. 
The first is a petition that asks parliament to take all measures necessary to ensure that the possession of child pornography remains a criminal offence. 
I think that is a reference to the supreme court debate that is ongoing at this moment.  
MAMMOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition calls upon the government to implement, enforce and develop uniform and mandatory mammography assurance and quality control standards in Canada.  
CRIMINAL CODE 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Finally, Mr. Speaker, the last petition urges parliament to uphold section 43 of the criminal code which continues to give parents the right or the opportunity to use appropriate discipline.  
FUEL PRICES 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I have the honour of presenting the following petitions.  
The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that Canadian consumers are deeply affected by price hikes. 
Although gasoline is a Canadian natural resource, Canadians have little control over this important resource. 
Therefore, the petitioners request that parliament encourage the establishment of a gas pricing review commission to keep the pricing of gasoline and other oil products in check.  
IMMIGRATION TAXES 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I have the honour of presenting these petitions signed by more than 100 concerned Canadians.  
The federal government imposes an immigration tax as a condition for obtaining permanent residence in Canada. 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, the following petition is signed by 46 interested Canadians.  
CHILD POVERTY 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have the honour to present the following petition signed by 88 Canadians.  
One in five Canadian children live in poverty. 
On November 14, 1989 the House of Commons resolved to end child poverty in Canada by the year 2000. 
The petitioners call upon parliament to introduce a multi-year plan to improve the well-being of Canadian children.  
MAMMOGRAPHY 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have the honour to present the following petition signed by a dozen Canadians.  
The United States has had mandatory mammography quality assurance standards since October 1994. Canada has no legislation for mandatory mammography quality assurance standard.  
Therefore the petitioners call upon parliament to enact legislation to establish an independent governing body to develop, implement and enforce uniform and mandatory mammography quality assurance and quality control standards in Canada.

QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
.[Text]  
Question No. 76- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
With regard to the groups consulted by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in the course of the legislative review ministerial consultations from February 27, 1998 through to March 11, 1998: ( a ) which of the groups received government issued grants and/or subsidies; ( b ) what was the total grant or subsidy; ( c ) what was the reason for the grant or subsidy; and ( d ) which government department issued the grant or subsidy?  
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Organizations in Quebec do not receive contribution funds from CIC. 
As per the Canada-Quebec accord, the province of Quebec assumes responsibility for providing settlement services.  
*Contribution agreements are signed for a total amount which covers the duration fo the agreement. 
As the period of time for which the funding information was requested does not coincide with the periods covered by the contribution agreements, we are unable to give dollar figures for the exact period requested by the hon. member.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The question enumerated by the hon. parliamentary secretary has been answered.  
* * * 
STARRED QUESTIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Deputy Speaker:
Is it agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed. 
.[Text]  
*Question No. 49- Mr. Guy St-Julien: 
Since 1990 have Natural Resources Canada, Environment Canada or Atomic Energy Canada undertaken or had universities and/or other Canadian university institutions undertake research or visits in the province of Quebec north of the 48th parallel in connection with pluton and/or granitic pluton with the aim of burying nuclear waste and if so: ( a ) how many studies were done; ( b ) what are the titles of the studies; ( c ) how many visits were there; ( d ) what locations were visited; and ( e ) which Canadian universities and university institutions were involved?  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gar Knutson:
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Is that agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET OUT IN THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN THE QUEBEC SECESSION REFERENCE 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.  
The Deputy Speaker:
When the House proceeded to question period the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington had the floor. 
He has five minutes remaining in his allotted time.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to resume my debate on this very important bill, Bill C-20. 
I was talking about the kind of stalling tactics the Bloc members are implementing on this very important and historic bill. 
I suppose that is part and parcel of where some of those people come from which is too bad. 
I do not think it is appropriate. 
I think it is quite unparliamentary.  
I want to say in review it really is shameful when we see something as important as this bill come forward that there are now amendments to amendments being proposed. 
It is a shame that 300 press clippings were read in the House and 1,000 amendments were proposed. 
It shows nothing but contempt not only for the House but for the Canadian people wherever they live in this great country of ours. 
It really is undemocratic.  
For the record indicate I want to indicate that on December 13, 1999 the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry said that everything they can do to slow down the bill to prevent its passage will be done. 
That really is shameful. 
That is not what democracy in Canada is all about.  
Let me say what the leader of the Bloc said not so very long ago on February 7: 
I can tell you that it's going to be a long process...very, 
very long...The 
record was 471?....more 
than that.  
The implication is that this is going to be stalled, this is going to be dragged out, this is going to be extended, all at the expense of democracy. 
That is unacceptable and that is not the Canadian way. 
It is simply outright rubbish.  
We on the government side will not allow them to get away with it. 
Why? 
Because it is not in the best interests of Canadians, wherever they live in Canada. 
We on this side of the House will ensure that does not happen.  
That is why we are crystal clear when it comes to Group No. 1, which we are debating today, which deals with the preamble. 
The House should not forget that this is a very simple bill that has three statements to it. 
It is very simple, very straightforward and very uncomplicated. 
It is those people opposite who are making it into something far greater than it was ever intended to be, and that is unacceptable.  
Let me remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the amendments in Group No. 1, which deal with the preamble, and now the amendments to the amendments which they are proposing, simply go counter to what we have in mind.  
The bill closely reflects the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference. 
Each of the preambular clauses is drawn from elements of the court's judgment. 
Despite the attempts of the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard, to conveniently ignore certain parts of the judgment, it is all important that all of its elements be reflected in the clarity act preamble.  
That is what we on the government side are doing. 
We are being straightforward. 
We are being simple. 
We are here elected from across Canada to represent every region and every area of this country. 
No matter where we come from, we are here to govern in an appropriate and solid fashion, and we continue to do that. 
Why? 
Because it is expected, it is required and it is necessary.  
When we brought in as a government the clarity legislation, Bill C-20, we did so with great intent, with great purpose, to ensure that people throughout Canada, and the world for that matter, who are watching this process will know that we come from a very solid and straightforward foundation, knowing that this is a time to act in a meaningful way on behalf of Canada. 
That is precisely what we on the government side, with the help of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, will do.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I, too, appreciate the opportunity to speak at least one last time to this bill. 
It is a bill which attempts to bring clarity, finally, to an issue that has probably been the most confusing issue for Canadians right across the country, not only in the province of Quebec but certainly in my riding and clearly from sea to sea to sea.  
Some of the statements made by members opposite I find rather interesting. 
First, I heard the hyperbole of the member of the New Democratic Party earlier today. 
In fact he was quite apoplectic, to say the least, shouting and going on about the fact that aboriginal Canadians are not named in the document- 
Mr. Peter Stoffer:
He is right.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney:
I am trying to reiterate it fairly and accurately because I want to point out the fallacy of the argument.  
The member could not understand and got awfully excited about why we would not include aboriginal Canadians in the list of people who should be consulted. 
I know the member knows this full well because he is one of the most knowledgeable people in the House. 
He has been around a long time. 
I give him credit for his success in this parliament and the length of his stay here, if nothing else. 
He knows that he could check the supreme court decision with regard to this. 
I will share this with members opposite.  
The final subsection of the bill stipulates that no minister of the crown shall propose a constitutional amendment to effect the secession of a province from Canada unless the Government of Canada has addressed, in its negotiations, the terms of secession expressly mentioned by the court, such as the division of assets and liabilities, any changes to the borders of the province-which the hon. member knows full well deals with aboriginal Canadians-the rights, interests and territorial claims of the aboriginal peoples of Canada, and the protection of minority rights.  
That is in the supreme court decision. 
I read that and I listened to the knowledgeable member of the New Democratic Party going on about the government not mentioning aboriginal Canadians in the bill. 
I wonder what has happened. 
I think I know. 
That member and members of that party are looking for a reason to oppose this bill. 
They are digging a little deep. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is absolute nonsense. 
The member was pointing out the fact that aboriginal people-and even the minister says that is not true- 
The Deputy Speaker:
I think we are into a point of debate rather than a point of order.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney:
Mr. Speaker, the member should seek an opportunity to rise in debate in a normal way instead of jumping up in such child-like fashion and interrupting the flow of someone who is trying to articulate a point which might be contrary to his and might be somewhat more factual. 
If the member does not believe that the supreme court decision I am reading is accurate, the member should say so, I suppose. 
But I do not know where he would be coming from. 
What is the point of that debate?  
Most of their ridings are in eastern Canada, in the maritimes. 
I am sure the people in the maritimes are about as fed up with this talk of separation as are the people of Quebec, Ontario, the west and our territories. 
I am sure they are all sick and tired of this whole debate and would like, once and for all, to put the rules straight on the table.  
The members look at it and say ``Holy smoke, they might have something here. 
They have actually put together a bill which says there has to be a clear question, that the appropriate democratically elected people in the country have to be consulted and there has to be a clear majority''. 
Frankly, I think that is what the majority of Canadians want, including those people in Quebec. 
In an attempt to find a way to oppose this bill, they have latched on to the tried and true aboriginal issue. 
We saw that in Charlottetown and in Meech. 
We came to recognize as a nation that if we want to try to amend the constitution, which is exactly what would be required under any attempt by a province to secede, the country is not governable in that sense. 
To amend the constitution of Canada is virtually impossible, to date at least, with perhaps one or two very minor exceptions to do with education, because any one person, as we saw in the Manitoba legislature, can refuse unanimous consent and hold up the entire country.  
Any premier can go back to the legislature of a province promising to hold a vote, renege on that vote, and the whole thing dies.  
If a member wants to throw something into the mix, throw in the tried and true aboriginal question and sure enough the process will be derailed.  
I do not understand where the responsibility lies for a Canadian parliamentarian to do that. 
I do not mind that someone disagrees with the bill. 
In fact I understand the Bloc members disagreeing with it. 
It is their raison d'être to separate.  
I found some of the statements of Bloc members really interesting. 
Let me share one with the House. 
One Bloc member said ``You cannot judge clarity because there are language differences''. 
Is that not an interesting situation.  
I wrote out what I consider to be, and what I think my constituents would consider to be, a clear question. 
Here is the question in French: voulez-vous vous séparer du Canada et devenir un pays souverain, oui ou non? 
Where is the language difference? 
Where is the problem?  
Members opposite do not like that question. 
We will see if we can get more money out of them. 
Maybe we will get you some HRD grants, or maybe we will not. 
Then I heard the same Bloc member say, and I found this to be astounding, that his constituents do not want clarity, they want money. 
That is what he said. 
They want money for economic development and jobs. 
These are the same opposition members who would stand to castigate the Minister of Human Resources Development for investing in the province of Quebec, in the various ridings of members opposite, and ridings right across this country.  
That is not the reason it is done. 
I do not care what party sits on this side of the House, that will always be, and should always be, part of the obligation of a government which tries to run a nation with the disparities and the geographical differences that exist in this country. 
Members ought to travel this land, go to places in Quebec and Labrador. 
Anywhere in this country they will see the need for government assistance.  
Finally, I heard a member stand to say that Quebecers were not consulted when other people were allowed to join this country. 
Presumably the member was referring to Newfoundland. 
I do not understand that. 
I say to the member, what about the rest of Canada when it comes to the province of Quebec voting on a referendum question that would indeed destroy this country? 
Does the ROC, the rest of Canada, not have something to say?  
Mr. Richard Marceau:
No. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney:
I think they do and they want a clear answer.  
My constituents have said to me that if they really want to go, let them go. 
I want to make sure that the question is darn clear before we are put in the position where we have to negotiate that kind of deal. 
That is what this bill does.  
I am a little frightened because Reform members support it, but I appreciate the fact that they do so because they have listened to their constituents.  
The House should pass this bill, and quickly. 
It should be passed so that we keep this country together and everyone understands the nature of the game.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I would like to say a few words about these clauses and explain why I believe they should not be included in the bill. 
In fact, I consider that the whole bill should have been withdrawn by the government.  
The first whereas that I would like to delete reads, and I quote: 
Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has determined that the result of a referendum on the secession of a province from Canada must be free of ambiguity both in terms of the question asked and in terms of the support it achieves if that result is to be taken as an expression of the democratic will that would give rise to an obligation to enter into negotiations that might lead to secession; 
As you will note, the French version of this text is in the negative, as it reads ``ne saurait être considéré''. 
This is not the way the supreme court worded its opinion. 
On the contrary, it said in the affirmative that the question had to be clear and that there had to be a majority in the qualitative sense of the term, equally clear.  
The legislation before us is not a clarity bill but legislation on bad faith. 
I will explain why I believe this legislation reeks of bad faith.  
First, the clarity of a question does not depend on the length of the sentence but on the way people perceive the issues behind the question in relation to their own interests. 
A question can be short or long, but the way people perceive their interests depends on the conditions in which the debate occurs and on whether each and every party will be allowed to express its concerns in light of the issues behind the question.  
In the 1995 referendum, the question was simple. 
This is a simple question that was debated not only during the referendum period, which lasted one month, but also long before that, considering that, in April 1995, during the Bloc Quebecois convention, the notion of partnership was introduced. 
On June 12, 1995, the three parties, the Bloc Quebecois, the Parti Quebecois and the Action démocratique, agreed on a basic partnership proposal to be submitted to the rest of Canada, should Quebecers vote for Quebec sovereignty.  
Well, no one in this House or elsewhere claimed that the question was not clear. 
Let me note that most people who claimed that the question was not clear do not read French, and, consequently, they simply repeated what they read in the papers concerning the so-called lack of clarity of the question.  
I think that, in Quebec, the question is so clear that the majority of Quebecers would know the question referred to even if all they saw on a sheet of paper was a yes and a no block. 
The issue was debated even before I was born. 
Everyone knows what is at stake.  
For many Quebecers, it is very clear that Quebec must acquire all the powers needed to ensure the future it deserves.  
However, some people think the House has the divine power to judge the clarity of a question better than average Quebecers. 
I want to point out to my colleagues, in all humility, that members of the House are average citizens coming from their environment of average citizens. 
On this side or the other side of the House, we do not have supernatural brain power that would place us above and beyond the people in our capacity to judge the clarity of a question.  
Average citizens know they are able to judge whether they have understood the question and whether they agree or not with the proposal made to them. 
Average Quebecers are as intelligent and as capable of judging the clarity of a question as any member of one side of the House or the other. 
That, through legislation, this parliament should appropriate the almost divine right to decide whether a question is clear or not, goes beyond the abilities, the competency and the very right of the House to democratically make decisions on behalf of the people.  
When people read a question, they assess it in terms of their interests and decide whether the proposal contained in the question suits them or not.  
This decision will not be taken by this House in place of the people. 
We do not have the right to do so. 
If we did, we would usurp the democratic right of each and every citizen. 
In that regard, Bill C-20 clearly goes beyond the prerogatives of this House. 
But there is even worse.  
Through this bill, the House also wants to give itself the right. 
The government side outnumbers the opposition side, that is got to form government in the first place. 
It always votes the same way as the Prime Minister, because this is the way our Parliament works. 
This bill enables, not this House, and not the government, but the Prime Minister and him alone to determine the clarity of a question and, worse yet, to determine the majority required to win a vote for sovereignty.  
In a democracy-at least this is what I was taught-each person has an equal right to vote. 
My vote is not more important than the vote of any other person, and nobody's vote is not more important than mine. 
This is the basic principle of democracy. 
Yet, this bill suggests that a vote could have more weight than another one, which is totally unacceptable. 
That is why I intend to now move a motion to amend Motion No. 2. 
I move: 
That Motion No. 2 be amended by adding, between the words ``were'' and ``consulted'', the word ``democratically''.  
Something this bill is seriously lacking. 
This amendment is seconded by the hon. member for Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The question is now on the amendment.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
This is very surprising. 
I will repeat what I had the pleasure of saying in a public forum organized by the member of parliament for Markham and presided over by ex-premier Bob Rae, that the revolutionary aspect of this bill is that the federal government by legislation voluntarily limits its prerogative, executive powers.  
There is no question that in 1980 when the first referendum arose there was no right under constitutional law or international law for a province unilaterally to secede. 
There was no right at all.  
The issue of what was a clear question and a clear majority, I could remind the hon. member for Macleod who referred to this earlier, was discussed very fully at that time, and it has been around.  
When the supreme court came into the picture it was because there was a plethora of individual suits before individual judges of the Canadian judicial system. 
The federal government had several options. 
One was to challenge the constitutional standing to sue of the individual litigants, which I think technically, in legal terms, might have been the better course. 
What we have in Bill C-20 therefore is what European Union jurists have rightly hailed as a rather surprising evolution in the rules as to self-determination going well beyond the European Union's own rules developed in 1992 for the special case of eastern European states and the issue of recognition under international law, which is of course one of the ways in which a new state comes into existence.  
What is interesting and surprising in Bill C-20 is that the federal government, so far from imposing its will on other people, is saying ``We are prepared to recognize a right of self-determination, to recognize it legally, but here are the basic conditions. 
We want to be sure this is what people want. 
What is the objection therefore to saying that we would require a clear question and a clear majority before we go ahead with this?''  
In these terms it is very difficult to see what all the fuss is about with this particular law. 
It takes nothing away from anyone in Quebec or any other province. 
It is an example of the federal government voluntarily limiting its own response and saying ``In the exercise of our prerogative powers in the future, we will consider ourselves bound by the expression clearly given of people of a particular province''.  
Now they are down to 400.  
Surely we are entering into an undergraduate game with frivolous, repetitive or otherwise uninteresting and boring propositions. 
Why should the business of the House be held up by this sort of activity?  
It is sometimes said that parliament is controlled by members and that there are no limits on the control members can exercise. 
People cite the parliament in Great Britain. 
You yourself, Mr. Speaker, are a student of that parliament and you will know that it has always been a very robust parliament. 
You will remember that Oliver Cromwell said to parliament, ``You gentlemen have been around too long for all the good you have done. 
Go, for the sake of God, go''. 
It is recorded that not a dog barked at their departure which was gently assisted by Oliver Cromwell's friends.  
What I am really saying is that it is a necessary part of the parliamentary process that the rules of the game are observed. 
We can have a tyranny of a majority but we can also have a tyranny of a minority. 
The British parliament has never hesitated to establish rules that ensure respect by all parties, majority and minority, for the rules of the game and for the ability of parliament to conduct the national business.  
There is a basic criticism of the parliament in Germany in the 1920s, a democratic regime that did nothing about the forces of evil of the right or the left in that situation. 
The German democracy collapsed as much from the inanition of parliament in exercising its powers to control the abusive use of parliamentary procedures as by the extremist forces outside.  
I am really saying to members of the opposition that surely the points have been well established in debate. 
What is achieved by wasting the time of the people of Canada, wasting the time of citizens who are expecting us to act on important bills? 
Has the point that opposition members have been trying to make not been made adequately enough in the debate?  
I have no doubt therefore that we will be forced as parliamentarians to consider proper rules to engage the orderly conduct of House business.  
One of the ideas whose time has certainly come is electronic voting, the United Nations system. 
I think those of us who like the happy ritual of elevating oneself and sitting down again and think it is a quaint old fashioned custom are having doubts about it. 
It is an idea that perhaps may go very quickly through the House, as well as the ability to establish new rules that ensure no one will be able to make an abusive use of parliamentary procedures. 
That is a tyranny of a minority carried out incessantly and carried out without proper respect for parliamentary customs and procedures. 
It can in my view be dangerous to the constitutional system that we all respect.  
Parliament is an ancient institution, but is also an institution of mutual respect that rests on a delicate system of checks and balances respected by all members. 
I would suggest to the members opposite that the Reform Party made the point with the Nisga'a treaty what can be done with parliamentary procedures.  
As a distinguished Reform member said to me yesterday, stated once it is interesting, stated twice it becomes boring. 
However it does direct attention to the fact that the pre-emptive concern with sovereignty association issues has been at the expense of this parliament's considering the modernizing and updating of parliamentary procedures. 
It is long overdue that we bring parliament into the 21st century. 
Decent rules that assure proper respect for other members' rights are part of that.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that I do not agree with my colleagues from Waterloo-Wellington and Vancouver Quadra when they say that the members of the Bloc are immobilizing parliament with their amendments. 
I think that it is very important for the opposition to be able to protest when they do not agree with a bill introduced by the government. 
If the Bloc members want to see the MP vote like little rabbits, jumping from on amendment to another, that is fine. 
That is stupid, but that is fine. 
If that is what they want, I have no problem with that.  
I believe most of the amendments moved at this stage of consideration of the bill are futile. 
I would like to explain why.  
The rest is only cosmetic. 
The two paragraphs that I consider important are 1(6) and 2(4).  
Paragraph 1(6) reads as follows: 
(6) The Government of Canada shall not enter into negotiations on the terms on which a province might cease to be part of Canada if the House of Commons determines...that a referendum question is not clear- 
The other paragraph says the same thing, and I quote: 
This is what is required to start negotiations on the separation or secession of a province.  
I am a strong federalist. 
Consequently, I believe my colleagues opposite are not looking for a situation where Canada would be dismantled by an unclear question. 
I believe this because I firmly believe in a united Canada. 
I also believe in the parliamentary process, as other members opposite, Reform and Bloc members. 
If there were a clear question on the secession of a province, I would have no choice but to accept it.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
Fifty per cent plus one, like Mr. Mills.  
Mr. John Bryden:
No. The situation with this bill is very simple.  
I do not think all members of the Bloc are separatists. 
Most are sovereignists or perhaps indépendantistes, but they are not separatists.  
In Quebec, some separatists are looking for winning conditions. 
I think that two winning conditions are a confusing question and a majority of 50% plus one.  
The Liberal government will not last forever, and it is unfortunate. 
Eventually, Reformers or Conservatives may form the government. 
I think Preston Manning, and perhaps Joe Clark also, could impose party discipline with a great deal of authority. 
In that case, the Reform leader would be able to impose the majority of 50% plus one. 
Perhaps the Conservative leader would accept an unclear question to get negotiations underway- 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Deputy Speaker:
I am sure he would not mind. 
I am sorry, I missed hearing the name but the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington will not, I am sure, want to allow that to continue.  
Mr. John Bryden:
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. 
I was under the impression that the Reform leader had resigned his position.  
The winning condition is simply to have a Reform leader, a Canadian Alliance leader, or a Conservative leader as government leader. 
These are winning conditions for the separatists.  
Bill C-20 prevents this possibility by conferring the power to determine if the question is clear, and if the majority is clear on that question. 
It confers such power to all members of the House of Commons. 
It creates a sensitive situation with respect to the question initiating negotiations for the break-up of the country. 
This responsibility is vested in all members, who would participate in some kind of a free vote. 
I think that most members of this House, including Bloc members, will vote according to their conscience.  
For these reasons, I think that this bill is good as it takes the power of the executive and gives it to the members of this House.  
I think this is true democracy.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague for the quality of his French. 
I have known him for four or five years and his French is improving. 
I am glad to be able to speak today to Bill C-20, however difficult it may be for us in this House to convince people.  
I followed closely the dynamics that developed since the introduction of the bill before Christmas and, like great philosophers, I like to ask myself questions.  
The first question I asked myself was why? 
Why want to trap Quebecers in the status quo? 
Then, I told myself I had to try to identify the interests of the party in power. 
Not only did the Liberal Party introduce legislation that is undemocratic, but it trampled several democratic rules that I want to address in my remarks.  
I came to the conclusion that the interests of the Liberal government are quite simple: it is interested in Quebec because Quebec sends a lot of tax money to Ottawa and that must not change. 
I found a few examples, and what is going on here in Ottawa is best described as misappropriation of Quebecers' money.  
In fact, taking into account several issues over the years-I was first elected in 1993-I believe that the government wants to keep Quebec in Canada because it is profitable for the government. 
It is not profitable for Quebecers or it is far less profitable for them, but for Canadians and the rest of Canada, for example, the motto is ``Let us keep Quebec in Canada and, if need be, let us lock it up in Canada''. 
At least I believe this is what the government is trying to do.  
Moreover, they tried to convince all the provinces to harmonize their taxes with the federal GST.  
We were asking $2.5 billion. 
And the federal government stubbornly said ``No, you are not entitled to this''. 
They said to themselves ``Let us keep Quebecers and Quebec in Canada, because it is to our advantage. 
We can compensate the other provinces, but let us forget about Quebec''.  
I remind the House that it was even suggested that an arbitration board could be set up between representatives of the federal government and Quebec arbitrate on this issue, and the federal government said no.  
Other examples come to mind, such as the Canada social transfer. 
The value scale of the Canada social transfer has always been based mainly on the wealth or poverty of the provinces or the regions. 
The government changed all that. 
Now it is just the demographic factor that counts, meaning that Quebecers have lost a lot of money, because Ontario is the largest province in demographic terms. 
It is the one getting the big chunk of federal money in the Canada social transfer. 
Another injustice for Quebec. ``Let us keep Quebec, it is very important to us. 
We can limit transfers, give a little more to the others and enclose Quebec in Canada. 
This is what we want, because it is to our advantage''. 
The question is always the same: what are the interests and why this bill?  
Another example is Public Works Canada. 
Yet 57% of contracts go to Ontario and 13% to Quebec. ``We have to keep Quebec in Canada, because it is a cash cow''. 
Quebecers pay full taxes to Ottawa, 25% of the tax base, but they are not given the equivalent. 
They have to be imprisoned in Canada.  
There is an annual $2 billion shortfall in Quebec. 
Then they tell us that Quebec does not know how to manage, that it has a huge debt, that it always has deficits, that the federal government has put itself in a good position and that now there is no deficit. 
We can understand why. 
I am giving examples of instances where Quebecers are continually shortchanged in Canada.  
Quebecers continue to contribute 25% of the tax base for National Defence, but only 18% of spending goes to Quebec and only 16% of the infrastructures are in Quebec. 
Another shortfall.  
Some even talk about a shortfall of 5,000 Quebecers in the military. 
An additional 5,000 Quebecers in the labour force would have a significant impact on the economy. 
Again, the federal government ignores this because it wants to keep Quebec a prisoner in the Canadian federation.  
These days, we hear a lot about the price of gas. 
I want to tell Quebecers who are listening that, for at least 15 years now, they have been paying 3 to 10 cents more than Ontarians for gas. 
Why? 
Because the government of the time decided that no subsidies would be paid to refineries located east of the Borden line. 
That decision automatically triggered a 3 to 10 cent increase at the pump in Quebec. Incidentally, three refineries in eastern Montreal have since shut down. 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is well aware of this. 
It happened almost in his riding.  
Mr. Réal Ménard:
In the riding of Mercier.  
Mr. Claude Bachand:
Canada wants to create health research institutes. 
Let us talk about research institutes. 
Twenty five per cent of these institutes are paid for by Quebecers who, in return, only get one of them out of 43.  
Research institutes are important. 
Contracts are awarded, well paid jobs are created and subcontracts help generate economic spin-offs. 
But no ``Let us keep Quebec a prisoner within Canada. 
At one point, Quebecers told themselves ``Let us try to correct things. 
Let us make reforms''. 
In 1982, the Constitution was unilaterally imposed by Ottawa. 
No Premier of Quebec, either sovereignist or federalist, has ever agreed to sign it as things now stand. 
Now what is this bill trying to do? 
It is trying to trap Quebec within the Canadian federation. 
After accusing the Liberals of diverting money belonging to the Quebec people, I accuse them of hijacking democracy because we have seen closure after closure with this bill, and a bold and unacceptable attempt by the government to restrict the number of amendments that the members could move, allowing ministers to move more.  
It is a good thing the opposition held together and managed to thwart these plans, but it will not prevent the government from trying to impose all its wishes on us, like closure to limit debate. 
We are told that we will be voting like little rabbits; this is what I understood a little earlier from one of my colleagues. 
What is this? 
Are we acting in a undemocratic way when we vote laws in the federal parliament the way we have been doing over the last hundred years?  
There is a limit. 
And it is not a question of money. 
The only thing we can do is a little bit of parliamentary resistance as far as the votes are concerned, and we are even blamed for that too. 
This is to show how the government intends to keep Quebec in the prison of confederation. 
The bill is quite undemocratic. 
Since when is 50% plus one not acceptable? 
Canada itself has recognized referendums that took place in Croatia and in Macedonia, where the 50% plus one rule applied.  
Furthermore, the question had two components, one of which was on partnership. 
Now, the government tells us ``No, there will not be any partnership. 
I want to say one thing. 
There is no single prison that will keep Quebecers in this federation when they decide enough is enough. 
There are not enough locks in all the Ottawa region to keep all Quebecers within the Canadian federation when they decide enough is enough. 
There is no prison that is tight enough to keep them inside forever.  
Quebec sovereignty is the only solution, with a partnership offer, and I hope Quebecers will understand this. 
I also hope that Canada will be open to this idea at that time. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this important issue. 
There is no greater issue that any member would address than the dissolution of his or her country. 
I am in somewhat of an ironic position because in the riding of Scarborough East, where I come from, this is, frankly, not an issue.  
Quite to the contrary, if I could characterize it as such, this is an issue that has almost fallen off the political map. 
In some respects my constituents see this as a done deal and they thank goodness that somebody has introduced some sanity into the debate.  
I have just spent a week in my riding, as did all members. 
What I heard were issues around Bill C-23. 
I heard about gas prices, as if I am somehow able to deal in some manner with gas prices. 
Health care is a significant issue to my constituents. 
I think those are probably the top three issues. 
I cannot recall anyone in the past week or 10 days writing to me, faxing me or e-mailing me about this issue. 
It is enormously ironic that arguably the most significant bill which the government will pass in its mandate has almost no response from my own constituents.  
When this bill was introduced by the government there was an initial sense of euphoria. 
Finally the Government of Canada was getting on with it. 
First, they liked it. 
I cannot phrase it any more bluntly than that. 
The message was, bring clarity to this debate. 
The tactics in this debate are hugely ironic. 
Bloc members, for their own reasons, and I am still at a loss to understand them, choose to take tactics of delay and obfuscation, introducing meaningless amendments and reading newspaper articles into the record. 
It does everything but deal with the issue and is quite reluctant to accept the political judgment of Canadians on this matter.  
Instead of dealing with what I perceive to be the political reality of not only my constituency but Canada and all Canadians including Quebec, which is that this is something that needs to be done, the Bloc's tactic in this matter is to delay and to waste parliamentary time.  
I have listened to the members opposite. 
I have some understanding of their issue. 
They consider this to be a unilateral decision which is something that is available to Quebecers and Quebecers only. 
That position has been debated and frankly they have lost the debate. 
After that there has been nothing of substance added to the debate.  
What I understand to be the situation is that the political reality in Quebec is much similar to the political reality of Scarborough East which is to get on with it, deal with it and finish it off.  
The position of the Bloc to my mind is unfathomable. 
I do not understand. 
It does seem to me that this has become a discredited political philosophy. 
Members opposite are unwilling to accept that this has become a discredited political philosophy, that they are in the death throes.  
Any studies I have ever read on the issue have said that Quebec does very well in its relationship with Canada.  
I cannot quite fathom what they are against. 
I looked up the speech of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
I thought it was one of the better speeches given in the House in a long time. 
He said in his conclusion that the bill is reasonable, that it is in everybody's interests including those of his fellow Quebecers who desire independence. 
They can and must acknowledge that their plans for political independence can only be realized in clarity and legality. 
I find the tactics of the Bloc to be quite disappointing. 
Raising irrelevant amendments and matters of procedure, slowing down the work of the House ending up in endless picayune discussions as to whether a comma should go here or there is a great disservice to what was and is a noble cause, namely the issue of whether Quebec is or is not a nation. 
To my mind it does no great service to the dream of René Lévesque and all those who have spoken so eloquently in favour of the position.  
It appears to me that the Bloc members are reluctant to accept a democratic result. 
They simply will not accept it. 
Again I go back to the speech of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
It states, ``In this matter the separatist leaders do not defend the rights of Quebecers. 
None of our rights as Quebecers are threatened in this bill. 
No. What the separatist leaders defend is their capacity to maintain confusion on their project. 
They are upholding their so-called right to confusion''.  
I was not aware that a right to confusion was in fact a charter or parliamentary right but I suppose this is something we will have to look at. 
It tends to diminish parliament in the eyes of my constituents and of other Canadians.  
In summary, my constituents want this bill to pass. 
My constituents believe that the time has passed for this endless discussion. 
My constituents want clarity.  
Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my colleague had to say and I see more and more that there are two entities in Canada: his and that of men and women in Quebec. 
I had prepared something for the year 2000, something that could give hope to the Matapédia-Matane people et to all Quebecers.  
The inaugural magic of great moments is difficult to conjure up for the humanity. 
As a magic date, a mythical passage, the arrival of year 2000 created a lot of hope in all our hearts. 
Many were disappointed, especially since the introduction in this House of Bill C-20. Like the whole of humanity, Quebecers entered the third millennium with a lot of hope and expectations.  
On the eve of year 2000, the people had the feeling, the belief that things could now be better. 
It was even said ``Peace and goodwill to all''.  
With the minister's Bill C-20, the government cast darkness over that environment. 
This minister could be called the ``son of darkness'', it is incredible how poorly he understands Quebec reality. 
Once in a while, legislation can be considered a comedy, but if I had to describe this one, I would have to say it is a terrible tragedy.  
People on the other side should have a hand dog look tonight. 
Mr. Réal Ménard:
They are rotten.  
Mr. René Canuel:
Yes, they are poisoned. 
We must judge a government, and especially the minister, by its legislation. 
This minister is arrogant and his legislation is provocative. 
Furthermore, Bill C-20 is an insult to and a crime against intelligence.  
It more or less tells the members of the National Assembly ``You are not bright enough, not intelligent enough to determine your own destiny. 
Mr. Bouchard, Mr. Charest, Mr. Dumont, you are three minus habens. 
You are waterboys, second class politicians or, as Trudeau told Bourassa, hot dog eaters''. 
That is what Trudeau said.  
Moreover, it is an insult to and a crime against freedom. 
My adolescent students used to say ``We are free''. 
They were right. 
I imagine that Quebecers are quite capable of freely making their own choices. 
Bill C-20 says the question must meet such and such requirements. 
Any other question will be considered as ambiguous. 
Is that freedom? 
Is that the extent to which freedom can be exercised in this Parliament?  
The federal government's judgment can supersede Quebec's judgment. 
As my colleagues said earlier, Bill C-20 is undemocratic. 
In 1980, the federalists won with 50% of the votes plus one; they were happy and they celebrated with champagne. 
In 1995, the federalists won with 50% plus one, and they really brought out the champagne. 
However, at the next referendum, if we win with 50% plus one, that would not be enough. 
According to the Prime Minister, such a result could not be recognized. 
The rules have changed somehow.  
I have always admired Mr. Ryan who, many years ago, was the editor in chief of Le Devoir and has also been the Leader of the Opposition in Quebec. 
He is a remarkable man. 
He said he would recognize these rules. 
Joe Clark, a former Prime Minister, said the same thing in this House.  
What is going on here is that they are using their strength to crush a whole people, the Quebec people. 
Never will the people of my riding, the people of the riding of my colleague from Charlevoix, whom I had the honour to meet twice, and the Quebec people as a whole go for such legislation.  
Ottawa's bill is not only abusive, it is unjust. 
Its proponents are acting with the arrogance of conquerors. 
Those who support them are serving a cause or purpose. 
What cause or purpose? 
To eradicate anything that makes possible the existence and the expression of a people that the constitutional order of the Canadian society obstinately refuses to recognize.  
We, in the regions, are fed up with a government, which, instead of trying to settle real problems and create jobs, is attacking our government, the government of Quebec and those who are truly elected by the people.  
This government dares to dictate our conduct. 
That is something that no one can or will accept. 
We find the dirty tricks of the present Liberal government pretty tiring. 
Even the Liberal MPs from Quebec, and that is what is sad and unacceptable, fail to understand and are not attuned to their constituents. 
I can understand this in the case of those representing anglophone ridings, but the member representing Bellechasse-Etchemins-Montmagny-L'Islet should have ears to hear what his fellow citizens are saying. 
After the next election, he will no longer be around. 
There is no way to ignore the sour note on which this past century and this past millennium came to an end. 
If the Quebec people were to bow to the yoke of Bill C-20, it would be a sign that we had been tamed. 
We would be just like the domestic animals on the farm to serve humans. 
I trust that my friends across the floor will understand, and I will offer a quick summary.  
If the people across the way want to put up fences, if they want to impose a yoke on us, if they insist so much on keeping us, this must be, I should think, because our values are superior to theirs.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin:
We are worthwhile from the financial point of view.  
Mr. René Canuel:
We must be very much worthwhile financially. 
I have been fighting for sovereignty for the past thirty years at least. 
I have federalist friends who, fortunately, are realizing more and more that Quebec must become sovereign, not to stir up trouble but to put an end to the squabbles, not to be an enemy but to be more of a friend, because they are going to live in one beautiful country and we in the other. 
We will then be able to reach out the hand of brotherhood and all will be well.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow the last three speakers.  
I have a small comment before I approach the clarity bill from the point of view of my constituents. 
We have just established Nunavut within Canada, an Inuit territory. 
We have the Acadians in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  
My friend says that we have the nerve to tell the French Canadians, the Quebecers, what to do. 
That is not so. 
The government has the responsibility to maintain the federation, if possible, and to see that it is not broken apart on a vague question because some people feel disadvantaged. 
Lots of people feel disadvantaged.  
The member for Saint-John, with whom I have worked very hard on a couple of committee, said that Quebec tax money is coming into Ottawa in undue amounts. 
That is not so. 
Quebec has been termed a have not province. 
That is not out of disrespect of course; it is due to the equalization payments of the provinces.  
Finally they were being paid at the same rate as Quebecers.  
My friend also said that we will stand up and sit down like rabbits to vote tonight, or soon. 
There is an easy way to cure that. 
They could withdraw the unnecessary amendments. 
Then we could all get on with the nation's business and discuss a lot of other important things that we need to do.  
Twice this afternoon speakers from the Bloc talked about sovereignty with a partnership. 
That is what a federation is. 
It is a partnership among equal partners. 
That is what we have in this country and we want to maintain it.  
I agree also with the member for Scarborough East. 
My constituents support this bill. 
They think it is long overdue. 
They are fed up with the uncertainty and the instability which the spectre of sovereignty raises every other year or so over industry, exports and farm products.  
The bill follows the supreme court decision on the Quebec secession reference and it asks for a clear majority on a clear question. 
My friends in the Bloc are upset about 50% plus one. 
In my experience on organizations, hospital boards, school boards, unions, Liberal associations and other associations, at an open meeting on a matter that goes to a vote, if there are six votes for and five against it passes. 
However, that does not hold for constitutional amendments. 
Most of the organizations I belong to require 66% or a two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment, and even that is only following notice and discussion which has probably taken six months or a year. 
Because it makes awfully good sense.  
It means that a rump group or a group of zealots cannot change the constitution of a well respected association, of a government, a country or a company by marching into the annual meeting and taking over. 
It is to preserve the policies, the methods, the rules by which we live, the rules by which we conduct our business. 
It is not to get around anything, it is to protect us from undue change and unlawful takeovers.  
Canada is unique. 
We have two founding nations. 
We have two official languages. 
In the schools in my county French language instruction begins in grade 3. 
We have French immersion in our public schools. 
We have French immersion in a high school. 
Students take all of their courses in French, and this is in the heart of southwestern Ontario. 
Our children know the value of the federation and their Canada includes Quebec. 
Since the 1995 referendum I have co-operated with my colleague from Brome-Missisquoi in Quebec on a student summer work and exchange program between my riding and his. 
Our young people know that Canada is respected around the globe. 
Canadians who travel abroad are always happiest when they return to Canada's shores and set foot again on Canadian soil. 
We will not have it broken up by frivolous and unworthy claims.  
The last clause in the bill states: 
No Minister of the Crown shall propose a constitutional amendment to effect the secession of a province from Canada unless the Government of Canada has addressed, in its negotiations, the terms of secession that are relevant in the circumstances, including the division of assets and liabilities- 
This sounds like a divorce to me. 
I wonder how many people have thought about what that would comprise and how long it would take, a possible change in the borders of the province.  
Most of the people I discussed the matter with are concerned about four changes. 
First, the Inuit of northern Quebec would obviously have to be given some territory because they would not stay with Quebec if they could stay with Canada.  
Second, the Cree of James Bay in northern Quebec would have to have a large chunk.  
Third, maybe the Outaouais-Hull area would want to become part of Ontario because its citizens do a lot of work here. 
They have been freely interchanging for years.  
Fourth, in my thinking about this I look at the independence of India and the partition between Pakistan and India. 
Eventually the two parts of Pakistan, thousands of miles apart, ended up as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate. 
I listened to many members of the Bloc Quebecois talk this afternoon to this bill. 
Listening to them, I have the feeling that they feel that unless people are from Quebec they cannot really relate to their vision of where Quebec should go, and unless people totally support their view of this bill, then those people have had no association with or understanding of their province.  
In 1984, after Mr. Trudeau resigned, I decided to support another Quebecer who had served the parliament of Canada for many years. 
The Right Hon. Jean Chrétien did not win the leadership of the party then, but- 
The Deputy Speaker:
I know the hon. member meant to say the Prime Minister and I know he will want to comply with the rules in every respect.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
You are right, Mr. Speaker. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister, who of course is now in his eighth year, has put this bill before the Parliament of Canada. 
Quite frankly this bill is a crafted jewel. 
I think this bill will go down in history as one of the best things the Prime Minister has ever done.  
I say that because I listen to my constituents. 
Not just in my community in Toronto but right across Canada there is a general feeling that the debate on Quebec's separation has gone on long enough. 
One of the reasons the debate has gone on so long is that the separatists, the sovereignists, the indépendantistes, whatever we want to call them, have constantly used clouded questions, shall I say every trick in the book, to try to confuse their own communities.  
The beautiful thing about this legislation is that for the first time we have the rules that will actually decide Quebec's right to sovereignty. 
No one will deny that right, but some basic rules will have to be respected: one, a clear question; two, a majority; and three, we have to make sure if those conditions are met that the political actors are put together to make that secession possible.  
I have not met anyone yet who is against the notion of a clear question. 
Why the Bloc Quebecois would argue the point with hundreds and hundreds of amendments on a simple clause is really beyond me.  
It was very interesting when we listened to witnesses. 
Some of the most respected leaders from the province of Quebec came before us and said that this bill is in order. 
Some members said that maybe they would challenge the process. 
Maybe they would like us to take a little longer and debate it. 
That is a fair comment but we are elected to lead. 
We are elected to govern. 
The leadership that is in charge right now has said that we have debated this bill long enough. 
It has three clauses. 
Let us get on with it and we will be accountable for it.  
One of the leaders who appeared before us was the former prime minister of Canada, the Right Hon. Joe Clark. 
He did not support the legislation. 
He felt if a situation ever did arise where a group of sovereignists were so effective and so passionate that there should be an environment where ambiguity could buy the Government of Canada some time so as to delay the process of negotiating the secession.  
In other words, we could argue that clause 3 creates an environment of debate and ambiguity. 
The reality is that it will take us years before we can decide on the ground rules. 
Maybe in that period of time people in Quebec will have had the opportunity to assess if they really do want to leave this great country.  
That is one of the special features of this bill. 
Even if there was a clear question and even if there was a clear majority, it would literally take years and years. 
There are people who essentially at the moment are focused on ripping this country apart. 
It would give us time and it would give the political actors in Canada the time to possibly drag this out until we put the right type of people in place through the electoral process.  
That is one of the genius components of the bill. 
One could argue it actually enshrines ambiguity. 
That is the irony of it: the clarity bill that enshrines ambiguity.  
Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have mixed feelings.  
First, I have a feeling of gratitude towards our colleague from Beauharnois-Salaberry and our colleague from Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans for their excellent work in committee, where they truly tirelessly defended the rights of Quebec. 
I have mixed feelings because despite this gratitude, I believe that all who speak out in support of democracy are in a sort of mourning today.  
I listened to our colleague, deliciously pompous as usual, remind us that the rule of 50% plus one suffered no exception. 
Spiritual son of Pierre Elliot Trudeau that he is, he should be covered in shame, because he must know that his mentor was a true supporter of the rule of 50% plus one.  
In committee, a witness by the name of Guy Lachapelle, an eminent political scientist-and I will seek consent to table the document after reading it and I dedicate a single quote to my colleague-quoted former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who made the following statement: 
Democracy genuinely demonstrates its faith in man by letting itself be guided by the rule of fifty-one per cent. 
For if all men are equal, each one the possessor of a special dignity, it follows inevitably that the happiness of fifty-one people is more important than that of forty-nine; it is normal, then, that- ceteris paribus and taking account of the inviolable rights of the minority-the decisions preferred by the fifty-one should prevail.  
It is signed Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Approaches to Politics , Montreal, Éditions du Jour, 1970.  
One cannot speak out of both sides of one's mouth. 
The reality is that no politician, except the Liberals, is saying that the Quebec referendum should not be decided by the National Assembly and that the 50% plus one rule should not apply.  
I challenge any government member to give us one example, and political expert Guy Lachapelle clearly said ``It is important to remember that no western democracy worthy of that name makes mention of a specific majority for a referendum''.  
I remind hon. members that the sovereignist movement is very comfortable with the notion of democracy. 
Do you know why? 
It is because three leaders of the sovereignist movement founded political parties to periodically submit the option to the public.  
From time to time, we have had the courage to submit our option to voters. 
Periodically, we have had referendums too. 
We have submitted our option to the referendum test. 
They took part in the 1980 campaign, and the one in 1995. 
The rule was 50% plus one.  
What was the first reaction the next day by that great Quebecer Lucien Bouchard, at the Mirabel Airport press conference, after we lost the 1985 referendum? 
What did the Premier of Quebec say? 
His behaviour was that of a democrat. 
The day after the referendum, what he told Quebecers was this ``A no is a no, but when the day comes that the answer is yes, then that will be yes, and that will mean yes''.  
We accept that rule. 
We are not saying that the 1995 outcome was too tight, that its validity is not recognized. 
We acknowledge that we lost the 1995 referendum, if only by 50,000 votes. 
A victory is a victory, if lost by 50,000 votes.  
Here in the House of Commons something rather dramatic is going on. 
I would like to share with the House just how much indignation is being stirred up in quarters where none is usually expected.  
Claude Ryan, that intellectual respected by those of all political stripes, he who was there during the discussions of the Fulton-Favreau formula, who was there for Victoria, who was there when the Parti Quebecois took power, who was there in 1995, who has been a minister, leader of the Liberal party, leader of the no faction, is a federalist. 
He is a self-confessed devout federalist, a militant federalist. 
He is a man of great discipline and no one can deny the discipline of Claude Ryan.  
I quote what he said: 
In the third ``whereas'' of the bill, the federal government, in accordance with this principle, recognizes that ``the government of any province of Canada is entitled to consult its population by referendum on any issue and is entitled to formulate the wording of its referendum question''. 
However, it contradicts this statement by including in the bill a clause giving the Parliament of Canada the power to interfere directly in the referendum process- 
If the National Assembly has the right to consult its population on a proposal to secede, it must be able to do so free from any constraint or interference from another parliament.  
That is what is bad about the bill. 
We accept that there is a split in Quebec between federalists and sovereignists. 
We wanted to include in the referendum act provision for the ability to express one's viewpoint, on equal terms.  
We are not in a situation where one option is more amply funded than another. 
In democracy, everyone is entitled to his viewpoint. 
The best way in a democracy to oppose an idea is to propose a better one.  
We sovereignists think that our idea, our viewpoint, our option are better than the federalist option. 
But this is not what we should be talking about today.  
Bill C-20 says to Quebecers ``Whatever choice you make, no matter how you read the constitutional future, there are people outside Quebec, in the federal parliament, who will retain a veto''. 
And that is unacceptable.  
Who are the allies of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs? 
I could say that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is not a democrat. 
I will refrain from passing personal judgement on the minister. 
When we think about the major central labour bodies, Claude Ryan and the student federations, we realize that the minister is a lonely man. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not find it easy to witness what is going on right now. 
It is never easy for democrats, for elected representatives to watch such wrongdoings.  
I will conclude by saying that we are convinced that, in the short and the long term, Quebecers will opt for democracy and, when they are consulted at the next federal election, they will fire this government, which has constantly bullied the National Assembly and trampled the democratic principles of which we on this side are so proud.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the quality of the speech delivered by the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and given our interest in Bill C-20, I request the unanimous consent of the House to allow the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to have the floor for an indefinite period of time.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is asking for unanimous consent to allow the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to speak for an indefinite period of time. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, what you have just heard and the debate by the member across the way does not deserve any continuation. 
I will join in the debate and say at the outset that Bill C-20 addresses the concerns of all Canadians.  
For years the people in my riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore and, I am sure, all across the country, have wrestled with the fundamental question of keeping our country together. 
They have wrestled with such questions as how will legislators deal with the possible secession of a Canadian province.  
Bill C-20 is squarely in line with the Supreme Court of Canada's opinion in the Quebec secession reference which states clearly that it is for the political actors to determine what constitutes a clear majority on a clear question.  
With Bill C-20, the federal government is delivering on its responsibility to all Canadians, giving Canadians an opportunity to make an informed decision about the breakup of our country. 
The clarity act is about good governance and democracy, values that we cherish in our political system.  
Madam Speaker, I want you to keep in mind those three words, good governance and democracy, as I proceed. 
What is happening here today in this debate does not speak to good governance and democracy as we hear from the members across the way; those values that we cherish in our political system, those values that are amplified in this clarity act which sets out principles and procedures under which the Government of Canada and the House of Commons must proceed if ever some day we are to decide on the clarity of the will to secede. 
It is a framework for the Government of Canada and it has the support of my constituents and Canadians across the country.  
There was a recent poll done around December 9 to 17. 
It was a CROP poll conducted for the Centre for Research and Information on Canada. 
Some 58% of respondents agreed with the government's intention to clarify the conditions under which secession could be negotiated. 
It is democracy and good governance.  
The numerous amendments by the Bloc Quebecois to the bill lack substance and are clearly an obstruction of the process. 
When we introduce amendments in the House we do so as members of parliament with the intention of improving the legislation and improving the ideas expressed.  
Motions Nos. 1, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12 as put forward by the Bloc do not have that intention. 
These motions propose removing the title of the bill, deleting the existing clauses in the preamble, gutting the bill and putting us back into a position whereby Canadians would not be able to get resolution to this thorny issue of national unity.  
The Bloc motions proposing the deletion of the bill title is aimed solely at stalling the procedures in the House, during the committee hearings, and are not intended to improve the bill.  
On February 15, appearing before the committee studying Bill 99 in the national assembly, the Bloc's intergovernmental affairs critic was already saying, and I quote: 
The difficulty we have, is that the bill is so blatantly unacceptable that to propose substantive amendments does not seem to us to be in the order of the day. 
Those who say that they want democracy and that the bill is undemocratic would not at the outset let the process take its course.  
My constituents want us to get clarity on the issue and to know that we can get over this difficult question that seems to come around almost in circles. 
They want us, as members of parliament, to do their bidding, to stand for a clear question and decisions so that however we move we will move with clarity.  
The title of the bill speaks to that clarity. 
Any discussion from across the way that would somehow say that this is undemocratic does not really speak to the intent of the bill.  
I have joined in the debate because I want to see clarity on the issue. 
I want my constituents to know that there are members on this side of the House who want to bring this question to a close, who want to see this legislation pass this House and who want to see us go forward into the 21st century with clarity so that whatever happens, all sides know exactly what the terms are.  
I call on my colleagues and those of the opposition, the Bloc Quebecois especially who are opposing this, that they allow the democratic process to take place and let the will of Canadians be heard through this clarity act. 
I call on everyone of us to join in ensuring that the bill is passed.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Madam Speaker, 18 months ago tomorrow, a year and a half to the day, I was elected by the people of the riding of Sherbrooke.  
At that time, I was proud to represent the people of Sherbrooke, and I still am. 
At that time too, I was convinced that I would find the purest expression of democracy in this House. 
How naive I was.  
At the time, he did not realize that he was going to become the spiritual father of the person we can now describe as one of the worst of Quebec's worst enemies.  
We of the Bloc Quebecois have tried on numerous occasions to enlighten the 26 Quebec Liberals, who are the worst enemies of Quebec, as well as the House as a whole, by asking repeatedly for unanimous consent to table documents, and the government refused. 
It refused to be enlightened.  
This past February 7, Parliament began its first sitting in this new millennium. 
Everyone thought the millennium bug was a thing of the past, but we now know this was not the case. 
In fact, we are pretty well certain that the millennium bug is the federal Liberal government itself.  
We are all aware of several viruses affecting the Liberal government. 
Of course, earlier in the year, there was the Minister of Industry's attempt to subsidize sports millionaires by giving direct favours to some helpful friends.  
At the moment, there is a scandal at the Department of Human Resources Development arising from political meddling intended to help friends or buy votes.  
The biggest virus, however, the most destructive, the vilest, is Bill C-20, the produce of a sort of germ or rather a two headed mite eating away at our democratic net like a sort of rat.  
So, on December 13, 1999, the duo of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tabled in the House of Commons an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Since then, the federal government has brought out its work boots to ram through a bill that disregards the political institutions Quebec has created and acts as if there had never been three referendums.  
Ideally, we would have Bill C-20 withdrawn. 
There are three good reasons for this.  
First, it gives the House of Commons power to disallow legislation passed by the National Assembly and a choice expressed by the Quebec people.  
The bill also denies Quebecers the freedom to choose their own political destiny and to include in a referendum question, should they so wish, a proposal of partnership with Canada.  
Bill C-20 denies the universally accepted rule of 50% plus one for the majority and the fundamental rule of the equality of votes. 
And the reason for this is clear. 
It is because the government knows that the next Quebec referendum will be a winner for the Quebec people. 
So, with this bill, the government thinks it can get out of its obligation to negotiate. 
It is supremely wrong.  
Not only does it want to get out of future negotiations, it does not even want to debate its bill in the House with the members. 
It proved it by imposing a gag on hon. members as early as second reading, then at the legislative committee stage and again, today, at third reading.  
A few years ago, in an interview on Quebec television, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former Prime Minister, stated that the people were sovereign and that a country could only be founded on the will of its people to be governed, and a free people must decide its own destiny and chose democratically its leaders.  
If we are free, no yoke or shackles must be put on us, nobody outside Quebec should dictate to us what to think or what to do? 
With Bill C-20, the federal government wants to force Quebec to do things its way, to impose the procedure and determine the rules of the game.  
If, as a Quebecer, I wanted to tell Ontario or another province how to manage itself, I would be told to mind my own business. 
That is exactly what the majority of the members from Quebec in this House, the National Assembly as a whole and many major organizations representing thousands of Quebecers are saying to the Liberal government in Ottawa: ``Mind your own business and get off our backs. 
We have the sacred right to make our own decisions''.  
Quebec is not a child, it is big enough to take care of itself without federal government interference. 
It can very well make enlightened decisions without Ottawa taking it by the hand or telling it what is good for Quebecers.  
With Bill C-20, the Liberal government is telling us, like one does with a child, how to define a fair majority, a majority that suits its needs. 
All over the world, the 50% plus one rule is the accepted majority. 
Here in Canada, which claims to be a cradle of democracy, the Liberals want to change this universally accepted rule, according to their mood. 
This is called controlling democracy.  
Some major Quebec organizations have condemned Bill C-20. The CSN, the FTQ and the CEQ formed a united front to condemn this unprecedented show of force against Quebec, and so have various other associations, including student federations, women's groups and community and social groups.  
Twice, for the 1980 and 1995 referenda on the future of Quebec, it was the National Assembly that set the rules of the game and no one in Quebec, whether in the federalist or sovereignist camp, challenged the legitimacy and democratic character of these two public consultations. 
We had the right to do it then, but not any more. 
We can do it one day, but not the next day. 
The Liberal government is playing with democracy as if it were a yoyo.  
On October 30, 1995, the no side won by a few tens of thousands of votes. 
The universal majority rule, 50% plus one, applied. 
Not one of those Quebecers who voted yes and who lost the referendum challenged the validity of that rule. 
We respected the public's decision.  
Incidentally, I remind hon. members that all the referendums held in Canada so far were based on the universal rule of 50% plus one. 
Canada has also recognized many countries created after referendums held according to the same rule. 
This is also the rule used by the United Nations when it supervises referendums on sovereignty. 
Why should the federal government not ask the United Nations to change its democratic rule and set an arbitrary percentage to dictate the procedure to other countries?  
If Quebec were sovereign, nobody would tell us what to do or what to think. 
We would not be in a federal yoke. 
The federal government was caught in its own trap when the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the legitimacy of the sovereigntist option and the obligation to negotiate on equal terms. 
Even if Canada does not recognize a yes at the next referendum, the other counties of the international community will if everything is done democratically.  
I am proud to be a Quebecer, even more so when people from Quebec are successful internationally. 
With sovereignty, it is Quebec as a whole that will be successful internationally.  
The time when they played tricks on us and decided for us is over. 
We are a great people capable of taking its destiny into its own hands. 
We want to be autonomous and sovereign. 
That, at least, is clear.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am truly pleased to stand in the House today as a member of the legislative committee that worked on the clarity bill. 
In a word I would describe the bill as brilliant.  
The separation of Quebec would have profound effects on the whole of Canada and its citizens, including Quebecers wishing to remain in Quebec. 
While I agree with this sentiment these are not my words. 
These are the words of Claude Castonguay, a former Quebec cabinet minister from the Bourassa government. 
The clarity bill is a reasonable bill. 
It is made up of three clauses. 
It is brief and it is straightforward unlike the 411 motions brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois with which the House will deal later today.  
In Motions Nos. 13 to 68 in Group No. 2 there are frivolous changes to the 30 day suggestion put out in the clarity bill. 
They range from 50 days to 250 days. 
They are not constructive and they do not improve this piece of legislation.  
The message we all took from the 1995 referendum was that we came dangerously close to losing our country on a vague question and a dubious vote. 
In 1995 the referendum question asked by the Quebec government was confusing. 
It read: 
Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign, after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership, within the scope of the Bill respecting the future of Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12th?  
Quebecers who voted on this question felt they understood, but when they were polled there was a great disparity as to what they thought they were voting on. 
While individuals were clear within their minds it was not a shared vision that they were voting on.  
The results of the referendum saw the yes side receive 49.6% of the vote and the no side receive 50.4%. 
Support fluctuated by 15 percentage points depending on whether sovereignty would be accompanied by economic partnership with the rest of Canada. 
Voter turnout for the referendum was high because Quebecers realized the stakes were high. 
Individuals, while convinced their interpretations were clear, did not share the common view.  
The clarity bill states that within 30 days of a provincial government officially releasing a referendum question on secession, the House of Commons would express its opinion by resolution as to whether or not the question is clear. 
If the House found that the vote on the question could not result in a clear expression of will by the population of that province on whether or not it would cease to be part of Canada, it would no longer deal with the question.  
In reaching its assessment the House would take into account the views of other political actors, political parties in the legislative assembly of the province whose government was proposing secession, other provincial or territorial governments and other legislatures.  
Soliciting a direct expression of will of the population of a province as to whether the province would cease to be part of Canada is a huge question. 
This has results that could not go back four years and be reversed. 
The Government of Canada would enter into negotiations only if the House had concluded that there had been a clear expression of will by a clear majority of the population of that province.  
In reaching the assessment the House would take into account matters it considered relevant. 
These kinds of issues need to be dealt with in context. 
The clarity bill spells out the qualitative aspect of both the question and the majority.  
Secession would require an amendment to our constitution. 
It would involve at least the governments of all the provinces as well as the Government of Canada. 
We would have to discuss such things as division of assets and liabilities, perhaps border changes from the province and of course the rights, interests and territorial claims of aboriginal peoples as well as the protection of the rights of minorities.  
One does not break up a country with 50% plus one.  
Quebecers have already said no twice to secession but the question keeps coming up. 
How many times is enough? 
Is it three out of five? 
Is it five out of seven? 
Is it seven out of twelve? 
How many times will we deal with this issue?  
No means no now but yes means maybe later. 
Yes is forever. 
Only a yes vote will give rise to irreversible change that will bind future generations of the country.  
The supreme court requires political actors to assess the clarity of any future majority in favour of secession. 
It uses the expression clear majority 13 times in its ruling to underline how much it feels this is an issue to be dealt with.  
The hon. member for Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok in Motion No. 2 states that the acceptable majority in the 1995 referendum was 50% plus one and therefore this is the threshold that should be used in any future referendum.  
Quebec's own referendum laws set no threshold for an acceptable majority precisely because referendums in Canada are consultative. 
This was recognized by the PQ government in its white paper leading to its referendum law which stated: 
The fact that referenda are consultative makes it unnecessary to include provisions about a required majority or a level of voter participation.  
The supreme court's opinion made clear that there was no precise numerical threshold which would trigger negotiations but that: 
It will be for political actors to determine what constitutes a clear majority on a clear question...in the circumstances under which a future referendum vote may be taken.  
When we ask Quebecers what they think, on October 30, 1999, the Government of Canada released a poll that was conducted of 4,992 Quebecers. 
It is one of the most important and precise polls, with a margin of 1.6% error, ever conducted on the question of national unity. 
The will of Quebecers was never again to undergo a confused referendum process such as those that we saw in 1980 and 1995. 
Quebecers want the process for any future referendums to be based on the principle of clarity. 
Most say it is reasonable to require a clear referendum question; 93% versus 4% agreed with this statement and on a clear majority 72% agreed versus 24% before Quebec can become independent.  
The majority of Quebecers say that the 1995 referendum question was not clear at a support level of 61% versus 36%. 
Quebecers are opposed to a unilateral declaration of independence if the yes side won in a referendum. 
The majority says it is reasonable that the Government of Quebec would have to reach an agreement with the rest of Canada before declaring independence.  
Quebecers say there is also majority support for the supreme court's decision that the Government of Quebec does not have the right to unilaterally declare independence. 
That was supported 55% versus 36%.  
During our two week consultation process when we again heard from many expert witnesses, many former colleagues at different levels of government came to talk to us. 
Ed Broadbent commented, when appearing before the legislative committee on Bill C-20, as follows: 
Of the 13 new countries to emerge following referenda in the post-World War II, post-colonial era, nine had positive results over 95%; two over 90%; and the remaining two in excess of 75%.  
He went on to say: 
In my view, Premier Bouchard would be a wise man if he waited until he could expect comparable results. 
He would be even wiser to abandon his secessionist goal and acknowledge the evident truth that the majority of Quebecers have made great gains in recent decades. 
By means of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians, they have created a wonderful and, dare I say it, distinct society. 
They are proud Quebecers and proud Canadians.  
The clarity bill defines the real stakes in a referendum. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, when he appeared before the legislative committee, said: 
On August 20, 1998, the supreme court gave a legal confirmation to that moral obligation. 
It is eminently desirable that we all respect that opinion, whether we are in favour of Canadian unity or Quebec independence.  
Secession is a black hole and I am convinced that the clarity bill is the best guide in making our way through.

BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to designate Thursday, March 16, an opposition day.  
* * * 
AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET OUT IN THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN THE QUEBEC SECESSION REFERENCE 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference, as reported (without amendment) from the legislative committee, and of the amendments in Group No. 1.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I had not intended to take part in this debate, but having been here this afternoon it may seem to people watching that this is a dispute between Ontario and Quebec. 
I know that hon. members opposite do not mean it that way, but because they are the closest to Quebec it sometimes comes across that way. 
Indeed, people from western Canada, particularly in my area, look upon this more as a debate down east that does not make reference to them.  
In my province the largest ethnic group is comprised of Anglo-Saxons, followed by the Ukrainians, the Germans and then the French. 
I was born in a French town. 
I refereed hockey in a dozen French communities, so I know very well what it is like and I am very proud to have lived in those French communities. 
My son-in-law's name is Tetreau and I am proud of that as well.  
Having said that, I am not about to leave the west out of this picture. 
As westerners are looking at this debate this afternoon, many of the people in my constituency are asking what we are arguing about. 
They are losing their farms. 
To them this is not an important issue over their individual issues because of what has happened.  
Let us take a look at what was handed to Quebec with confederation. 
It was guaranteed 24 senators. 
That is the same as the four western provinces. 
It was also guaranteed so many members of parliament, regardless of what happens to its population. 
The only other province which got that guarantee of course was Prince Edward Island.  
What we do not understand about this is, when people talk about a sovereign nation, nobody explains to the people west of Ontario what they mean by that. 
To westerners a sovereign nation is a separate entity unto itself. 
It has its own laws, its own money system, its own trade and commerce, all of that. 
It is indeed a separate nation.  
When I read what Quebec voted on, it talked about sovereignty and then all these other things. 
As far as the people of western Canada are concerned-and let me say that it is very clear as I travel in western Canada-if my hon. friends in the Bloc want a sovereign nation, it will have to be the total meaning of sovereignty. 
It will not be some sort of association. 
It is one or the other. 
They cannot have it both ways.  
We do not ask for separate identities. 
The Europeans are coming together for particular reasons, because they are bound by international agreements or monetary agreements. 
Quebec would have to have a separate agreement entirely. 
Otherwise, B.C. would want to go. 
Not too long ago it was the four western provinces. 
Some of my friends from the west will remember the WCC, the Western Canada Concept Party. 
That is what it actually wanted. 
Its separation was based on a financial barrier, for obvious purposes.  
While my people are floundering around trying to understand how they are going to live for another year, we have people here whose reasons to become separate and totally apart from Canada they say are not based on economics. 
That could be proven.  
It has never been quite clear to the people of western Canada why these people are attempting to separate. 
To be honest with you, Madam Speaker, in all of my reading and following of this issue, that issue has never become fundamentally clear to me and it has never been fundamentally clear to the people beyond Ontario in western Canada.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
This bill, supposedly on clarity, will be passed through a process that can hardly be considered democratic.  
This bill has been very well understood by David Jones, a former minister-counsellor to the U.S. embassy from 1992 to 1996. 
In an article published in a publication available to all diplomats in Ottawa and elsewhere, he wrote ``In any case, this bill on clarity is a masterpiece of political ambiguity. 
This is still David Jones talking, a former minister-counsellor to the U.S. embassy in Ottawa from 1992 to 1996. 
He said ``Without saying it in so many words, Ottawa rejects the questions of the 1980 and 1995 referendums''. 
We are not the ones saying that. 
This is what David Jones said.  
What else does Mr. Jones say? 
He says ``When it moves away from the basic political rule of 50% plus one, without proposing another percentage, any democracy is moving in unchartered waters''.  
( a )-merely focuses on a mandate to negotiate without soliciting a direct expression of the will of the population of that province on whether the province should cease to be part of Canada 
This is very serious. 
It comes back to the explanation given by David Jones. 
Moreover, a question will not be considered clear if it: 
( b )-envisages other possibilities in addition to the secession of the province from Canada, such as economic or political arrangements with Canada- 
With these two paragraphs, as the former political adviser of the United States embassy says once again, the government is retroactively stating that both referendum questions were not clear.  
If, in the historic progress of the Quebec people, there is one thing that is clear, with respect to the movement that appeared with several small parties, but flourished with the Parti Quebecois and later with the Bloc Quebecois, it is that this movement is part of the ever-changing modern model that everyone here is applauding, that is the model of the European Union.  
I again quote from a text written by René Lévesque that he presented to activist members in his riding of Laurier, before submitting it to the Liberal Party, which rejected it. 
He said ``We believe that it is possible to avoid this joint stalemate of the Canadian federation''-joint stalemate where the government introduced Bill C-20 instead of talking about the situation of Western farmers-``by adapting to our situation the two major tendencies that dominate our era, one of which is the freedom of peoples and the other is political and economic groups freely negotiated''. 
This was in 1967.  
How is it that no colleague from the other side tried to respond to our repeated claims that this bill is deceptive because it gives English Canadians the illusion that it will make the sovereign independent movement disappear in a jiffy?  
This is an illusion and a danger because it implies that the process is an easy one, that they only have to say no and to pass a bill for the sovereignist movement to disappear. 
This is not so.  
It is amazing, but no one talked about the will to negotiate. 
Having met an angel on his way, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wrote ``No, sovereignty partnership is not moderate because, between sovereignty partnership, the referendum and its conclusion, secession occurs''. 
That is it.  
He does not say that he will not have the means to object.  
For example, in a referendum where the question is on the partnership option, if the results are 53.5%, 
given a strong vote like the last time, you will not be able to initiate any negotiation because those who pay down the debt will pressure you. 
You will not be able to resist the people's pressure. 
We are not the ones who are creating confusion, you are.  
I sincerely regret all the time spent to try to thwart the sovereignist movement, or to convince Canadians that there is nothing to worry about, that the government will rid them of that gang, as the government House leader has said, speaking about us. 
Well, I have got news for you because there is a good chance that the Bloc will be even stronger next time.  
In spite of this vote, in spite of this charade, this travesty of democracy that is the exceptional procedure used throughout consideration of this bill, I hope that our colleagues opposite will seriously think about the relations between Quebec and Canada. 
We have no choice because we are neighbours and we will remain neighbours for a very long time.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to participate in the debate on Bill C-20. I would like to do so by referring to some of the motions or the amendments that have been put forward today.  
I would like to speak to the motions in Group No. 1.  
Group No. 1 deals with the preamble of the bill. 
The preamble itself contains eight clauses. 
In addition to the preamble the clarity bill itself is actually very clear and straightforward. 
It contains three operating clauses.  
I do so by looking specifically at Motions Nos. 5 and 9 and talking a bit about the preamble. 
The bill closely reflects the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference. 
Each of the preamble clauses is drawn from elements of the court's judgment. 
Despite Premier Bouchard's attempt to conveniently ignore certain parts of the judgment, it is important that all the elements be reflected in the clarity act preamble.  
When we look at Motions Nos. 5 and 9 which are the motions I would like to start with, we will note that Motion No. 5 seeks to delete a word from the first clause of the preamble. 
So that Canadians know what we are talking about, clause 1 of the preamble states: 
Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that there is no right, under international law or under the Constitution of Canada, for the National Assembly, legislature or government of Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally; 
Instead of a motion being brought forward by my friends in the Bloc to question or to amend this, because I have heard time and time again the amendments are here to make the bill better, what does Motion No. 5 say? 
Motion No. 5 states that Bill C-20 in the preamble be amended by replacing lines 1 and 2 on page 1 with the following, and it deletes the words that the Supreme Court of Canada ``has confirmed'' and replaces them with the words the Supreme Court of Canada ``is of the opinion''.  
Are we talking substantive amendments or are we talking as in my days as a lawyer of what we would call frivolous and vexatious motions? 
Let us look at that.  
Let us move to Motion No. 9 which again is a substantive amendment with so much rhetoric across the way saying that they are are trying to make this bill so much better. 
What does Motion No. 9 say? 
Let us look at clause 4 of the preamble. 
It is important for Canadians to know what we are talking about. 
We are not talking about the government abusing democracy or wanting to invoke closure so that we do not have the ability to debate or make substantive comments. 
We are talking about proposing frivolous and vexatious motions.  
Let us look at what clause 4 says: 
Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has determined that the result of a referendum on the secession of a province from Canada must be free from ambiguity both in terms of the question asked and in terms of the support it achieves and that result is to be taken as an expression of the democratic will that would give rise to an obligation to enter into negotiations that might lead to secession; 
What part of that section of the preamble has been moved to be changed? 
Are we amending ambiguity? 
Are we amending that there is an obligation that negotiations be entered into? 
Are we amending anything substantial?  
It sounds like Motion No. 5 because again they want to delete a word. 
The word this time is not ``confirmed''. 
It is the word ``determined'', whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has given an opinion, instead of using the word ``determined''.  
Those are the substantial democratic amendments the members of the Bloc have proposed. 
Is it so substantive that we change the word ``confirmed'' to ``determine''? 
What is wrong with those words?  
I remind members of the House of Commons that certainly as a lawyer who practised 18 years and as a member of the Ontario bar, I knew that when the supreme court made a pronouncement it was regarded as highly persuasive and binding on all lower courts.  
Governments in Canada have always acted as though reference opinions were binding on them. 
Governments not acting in accordance with reference opinions risk legal challenges on any aspect of opinions dealing with legal issues. 
Is this a question of semantics or is this a question of substance?  
I would also like to quote what the supreme court noted in the reference regarding remuneration of judges of the provincial court. 
The court stated: ``The fact that this court's opinion is only advisory does not leave the parties without a remedy. 
Opinion, determination, confirmation; is it truly necessary that for this first group of amendments, Motions Nos. 1 to 12, that we sit here for two or three hours to determine on the preamble? 
What in substance is talked about in the preamble?  
Motion No. 2 did address the fact that whereas when the Quebec people were consulted by referendum in 1995, the winning choice was the one that obtained the majority of the votes declared valid, that is 50% of the votes plus one.  
That could possibly be a substantive amendment, but what is intended and what does that accomplish by putting that amendment in? 
We could also go into the history of Canada from the date of confederation and the British North America Act and what powers were given to the provinces and Quebec's special status in Canada. 
We could do that as well.  
Sometimes people just say things for the sake of saying things. 
I would submit that Motion No. 2 is exactly that.  
If my friends in the Bloc were actually true to their substantive amendments, why is it that they propose in Motion Nos. 5 and 9 that the words ``confirmed'' and ``determined'' be substituted by the words ``of the opinion'', but at the same time in previous Motion Nos. 4 and 8, they seek to delete both paragraph one of the preamble and number four? 
And if they do not get away with that, then in Motion No. 3 they completely seek to strike out the entire amount of the preamble.  
I say to all Canadians, is what we are seeing here substantive amendments? 
I would submit that that is not the case. 
In fact this is not a case of democracy at work, but it is truly a case of parliamentary procedure being abused at best.  
Why is the federal government taking this action in the face of such strong opposition? 
I would submit that the government has taken this decision because Quebecers have a right not to lose their country unless it is clearly expressed in their will and unless negotiations are concluded that respect the rights and interests of all Canadians.  
As the only government representing all Canadians and as one of the parties in possible negotiations, it is important that the Government of Canada signal the circumstances under which it would enter into negotiations that could lead to the breakup of this country. 
Given the dramatic consequences of secession, it is in the interests of Quebecers and all other Canadians that such negotiations only be undertaken if it is the clear will of Quebecers that they no longer wish to remain in Canada.  
When we talk again about substance or frivolity, when we talk about democracy or abuse of process, I would ask all Canadians as they watch tonight and for the next 54 hours that they determine what truly is happening here.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
It should have gone through the House without any debate at all.  
This is a straightforward bill that acknowledges the right of the people to decide. 
All this bill does is to say that in this partnership that we are in, if one of the partners wants to leave and go on its own, it is important to at least discuss the partnership. 
That is what this bill is all about.  
There has been more than one occasion of this so far. 
Two or three times in a row when asked to vote on the whole question of whether or not they want to remain a part of Canada, the people have decided they want to remain as part of Canada. 
The question is when is this debate going to end?  
None of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois have stood up to tell us when enough is enough. 
When would the separatists say enough is enough? 
They lost the first time. 
They lost the second time. 
We will continue to have a nation for the next 10,000 years, just as we have had for the past 10,000 years.  
The bottom line is that the Supreme Court of Canada has rendered a ruling. 
Even the premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard, and others have clearly applauded and clearly stated that they want the federal government to obey the decision of the court. 
We are saying that at the federal level in order for us to decide whether or not we are going to participate in the breakup of this partnership, two things are absolutely unequivocal.  
First, there should be a clear question that is straightforward with no monkeying around and no ups and downs. 
The people have to be asked a very clear question. 
That is fair and none of my colleagues will dispute that.  
Second, there has to be an absolute majority, a clear majority. 
I do not think any one of my colleagues would object to that. 
If we were to ask a question of the people and have a clear answer to it, then let us sit down and talk. 
That is what the government is doing, unlike my colleagues opposite who are trying to break up one of the best countries on earth. 
It is the best country on earth. 
It is not just me and my colleagues in the House of Commons who say that. 
Every single person in the country knows that this is the greatest country on earth.

Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I think it would be a good idea for you to enlighten the House at this time. 
I have heard a number of Liberal members wondering whether one of our colleagues wearing a turtle neck is entitled to vote.  
I tell them he is entitled to vote, but they stubbornly insist- 
The Deputy Speaker:
All members in the House are always entitled to vote. 
I have heard no mention of this. 
We will therefore continue with the votes.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:
Mr. Speaker, in order to enlighten this House I raise a point of order. 
I ask you whether a colleague in this House wearing a turtle neck is entitled to vote.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am well aware that it is late, but if I remember what the Speaker said the last time we discussed this matter, we decided that a tie is not required for a member to vote in the House.  
I think this is how we decided. 
It is fairly late and perhaps a little too late to look at all the precedents on this. 
Perhaps tomorrow we can no doubt look at this.  
I cannot recognize the member for Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok for the moment.

The Deputy Speaker:
Undoubtedly.  
Mr. Richard Marceau:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If you had been, as usual, kind enough to give me the time to vote, I would have voted like the whip of the Bloc Quebecois.

Mr. Réal Ménard:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Paul Crête:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With your hasty decision, you prevented me from voting and I believe I should have had the right to vote on this motion. 
I ask that my vote be recorded in favour of the motion.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As you know, members vote from the front to the back rows. 
At one point, you asked what members were against the amendment. 
We were penalized and we ask that our vote be recorded.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
The Speaker rose and when he does, honourable members have to sit down.  
It is obvious that some members wished to vote on the last vote but did not rise when the vote was taking place. 
There is some obligation on members to move when the clerk at the table is calling the vote.  
The Speaker has an obligation before the House to continue with the work of the House. 
If members want to vote, I can solve this problem immediately.  
Is there unanimous consent for the members of the Bloc Quebecois who did not vote on the last question to be recorded as having voted like on the previous question?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
The Deputy Speaker:
We can resolve this problem, unless there is not unanimous consent to apply the vote. 
We have no option now but to continue to vote. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
I will not hear any more points of order.  
Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:
Mr. Speaker, if you will allow me, and since you prevented me from voting earlier, I would like my vote recorded with that of the Bloc Quebecois and would like to ask you where in the Montpetit-Marleau the time limit for voting is defined? 
Do you decide on the time limit? 
That is my question.

Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I must tell you that something of some concern happened a few minutes ago. 
Simply because a colleague took too long, in your opinion, to rise, you deprived the members in the subsequent rows, that is, the second, third, fourth and fifth rows, of their right to vote.  
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
How can you assume, simply because a colleague delayed too long to vote, in your opinion, and knowingly- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
Mr. Speaker, could you tell our colleagues opposite to stop bellowing for a few minutes, so I can finish making my point?  
How, simply because a colleague- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
I want to hear the point of order of the hon. whip of the Bloc Quebecois and I hope we may all hear him.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
Mr. Speaker, once again, how could you, simply because in your view a colleague took too long to vote, decide out of hand that no other colleague in this House could vote for or against a motion? 
On the basis of what precedent, what jurisprudence or what Standing Order do you decide you can deprive members of their right to vote simply because one member apparently took too long to vote, in your opinion?  
The Deputy Speaker:
I know that the hon. member has read the new book on procedure. 
The Chair has a duty to the House to continue proceedings. 
No one rose at that point to support the motion. 
There were two votes in favour, and no one-neither the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm nor any other member of the House-rose.  
I thought that everyone who wanted to vote for the motion had already done so and so I called for those who wished to vote against it. 
I obviously made a decision that was not exactly shared by the other members. 
That is too bad, but the decision has been made, and we can continue to vote. 
Clearly, if members wish to vote, they must rise. 
This is always the rule in the House. 
We can now continue, because I believe I have answered the question of the hon. whip of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:
Mr. Speaker, according to the procedure generally recognized in this House, so long as the members in the first row have not finished voting, the members in the second row do not begin voting.  
How do you expect my colleague from Joliette to rise in support of the motion when our colleague from Berthier-Montcalm had not yet risen? 
There has been a sort of procedural error, and I would like you to tell me exactly-for the gallery, you referred to Montpetit-Marleau-what allows you to do what you did a few minutes ago?  
The Deputy Speaker:
As I have already indicated, I gave my reasons. 
Members are required to rise quickly in a vote. 
This is perfectly reasonable in a vote, and it is in keeping with House precedents in this regard. 
I will find a quote later to answer the request by the hon. member, but I repeat once again what I said.  
The Speaker has an obligation to continue with the work of the House. 
If members in one row or another choose not to vote, it is not for the Chair to look to the next row. 
Members must rise if they wish to vote and that is what I have decided.

When the vote is being called, I wonder if members would please not jump up and down and exchange seats. 
It makes it almost impossible for the vote callers.  
In addition, members should not wander in and out when the vote is being called on this side or the other side, and let us not hold up any signs. 
This is still the House of Commons. 
It may be early in the morning, but we will still conduct ourselves as we should.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Since 73 votes have been registered and there are close to 400 votes left, I would like to know what will happen to the committees that would normally be sitting today, including the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development where the internal auditor is scheduled to appear to shed light on- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

Committees are creatures of their own.

Oh, oh.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No, I will not. 
I recognized the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques on a point of order. 
The point of order would have to have something to do with what is going on in the House right now, for example the order of the vote. 
If your point of order is pertinent to what is happening right now I will listen to it, but there is no other reason.  
Mr. Paul Crête:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order specifically in reference to the vote, because I want my right to vote as a parliamentarian to be respected. 
I am indicating that certain committees are scheduled to sit today and my right to vote in this place might be affected if committees are sitting at the same time.

Did everybody understand that? 
For a member to vote the member must be in the House when the question is put. 
If the vote is obvious in one direction or another it is not a problem but imagine if the vote was very close. 
The rule is that if members are not in the House they cannot vote.

You are asking which members are for and which against, and then you are moving immediately on to the recorded vote, without a decision from you as to whether the yeas or the nays have it, and as to whether five members have risen to call for a recorded vote.

Mr. Yvan Bernier:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been in this House since the voting started last night. 
I have seen all sorts of things happening. 
What has just happened is the House of Commons game. 
Members have to answer questions when the time is right, and they have to face the consequences of their mistakes.  
I feel the need to point out that, when one of our members was not in his seat last night-he was in the House but not in his seat-we lost a motion, namely Motion No. 84. 
Your slowness in acknowledging that they were not standing casts somewhat of a shadow over your impartiality, Madam Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I can assure the hon. member- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Order, please. 
I can assure the hon. member that I saw four Liberal members on their feet here, plus one more right at the back of the room. 
He was standing, right at the back. 
So, there were five in all.  
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The next question is on- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
I will not accept the behaviour of the member whose riding I shall not name for the moment. 
I caution the hon. member that, if he does not calm down, I shall take the necessary steps.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Madam Speaker, I think everyone is tired. 
That is understandable.  
What I wish to ask, however-and we have it on tape-it takes- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Could the hooligans be asked- 
An hon. member:
That is what happens to cheaters.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Another comment from the hon. member and I will be forced to take the necessary steps and name him. 
For the moment, the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois has the floor.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Madam Speaker, I would have appreciated it if you had asked the hooligans across the floor to pipe down while I was speaking, but you did not.  
That said, and we have it on the tape, members are taking a good 45 seconds to rise. 
In future, I would request that you not give them a signal to stand but let them act on their own, as happened this time.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is an accusation which I reject outright, because I have never signalled any member or told any member to rise. 
Let that be clear.  
The next question is on Motion No. 175.

Mr. Daniel Turp:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The speed at which you are reading out these motions is more akin to that of an auctioneer or the commentator at a horse race than to that of a Speaker of the House of Commons.  
This being a bill on clarity, it would be necessary for what you are reading to be clear to all those who are listening.  
The Deputy Speaker:
It is always the desire of the Chair to serve the House, for-as hon. members are aware-the Chair is the servant of the House. 
We do not, however, wish to waste time with these motions. 
This is the third- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
This is already the third time these motions have been read to the House. 
All hon. members also have before them, or available to them, the Order Paper, in which the motions are all listed. 
I always give the motion number as well. 
Hon. members can eve read them in both official languages. 
I therefore believe that, even at the speed I am reading, it is possible to understand what is being said.  
In my opinion the point of order does not apply.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
Mr. Speaker, am I to understand that what you said was that we are wasting the time of the House with these amendments and motions? 
Is that what you said, Mr. Speaker? 
The Deputy Speaker:
Not at all. 
Perhaps how I said it in French is what caused the problem.  
I said that the Speaker does not wish to waste the time of the Chamber in going slowly in reading when it is the third time these motions have been read to the House, and members have in front of them copies in both languages so they can easily follow.  
That is why I read a bit quickly, but I did not suggest that the time of the House is being wasted. 
It is not up to the Speaker to suggest such a thing.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
For the record, Mr. Speaker, I wish to repeat that you said we are wasting the time of the House, whereas we have rights in this House and we are claiming our democratic rights to debate a bill.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney:

The Chair must continue with the voting at this time.

Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In order to respond to the arguments of the government House leader, who finds that this voting process is costing the taxpayers a great deal of money, I have consulted with the other three opposition parties, and we propose, and request of this House, unanimous consent for the division to be held during the regular sitting hours of the House. 
We are doing so in response to the demands of the government.  
I can state that all opposition parties would be in agreement on this. 
If we do not obtain unanimous consent, then the party in government will bear the responsibility. 
People will see how hypocritical they are.  
Some hon. members:
Hear, hear.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
Is there unanimous consent of the House?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
The Deputy Speaker:
There is obviously not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Mr. Speaker, I would like you to explain what you mean by ``obviously not''. 
I do not understand your comment.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I heard many nays, so it is obvious that there is not unanimous consent.

Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
You are perhaps in a hurry to get home to bed, but I would like you to read the motions more slowly.  
Earlier, for Motion No. 270, you mentioned clauses 1 and 30, when it was a case of clauses 1 and 3. 
We voted on that.

Oh, oh.

Mr. Yvan Loubier:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I would like you to clarify certain rules for us. 
Earlier, the clerk called out the names of several Liberal members who were not standing in their place. 
I would like you to tell us what the rule is. 
Do members have to rise so their votes can be recorded or does the clerk call out their names automatically even though they are sitting down? 
That was the case for at least seven Liberal members earlier. 
Can you clarify that rule for us?  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am sure the only votes that are counted are those of members who are standing in their place when the division is taken. 
I will look more closely to make sure that this is the case. 
I thank the member for his vigilance.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier:
Mr. Speaker, I think it would be preferable to start all over again in this case. 
I saw at least ten Liberal members who were sitting down but whose names were called out by the clerk with those opposing the motion- 
An hon. member:
A procedural error has occurred.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier:
There were at least ten of them.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am certain that the clerk counted the members only when they were standing in their places. 
I am sure that is always the case. 
We do not want to recount the vote at this point.

Speaking of the interpreters, there is a brilliant interpreter in the booth who usually travels with the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.  
Speaking of fisheries, it is approximately 4.30 a.m. in Newfoundland. 
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to hear whether the member for Gander-Grand Falls thinks that the people of Newfoundland would be more interested in speaking about the economic problems faced by fishers than about-

Before we get to the hon. member's point of order, I want to do a point of order of my own. 
This is the rule:
Members have to be in the House when I put the question to vote. 
If members are not in the House when I put the question, they do not vote. 
No cell phones are allowed, not even behind the curtain. 
If any other member wishes it, send me a note. 
On a point of order the hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When I rose to vote, you very clearly heard-the whole House heard-absolutely disgraceful remarks which I will not repeat here, because it would show a lack of respect for the House. 
I know that it is 3 a.m., but people may and should be watching.  
I ask the member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke to withdraw his words and to show that he knows how to behave properly in the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sure the hon. member would be quite happy to withdraw the words.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find unanimous consent for what I am now proposing.  
As the pages have been doing an excellent job-since midnight we have a new group-I think the House should thank them for a job well done.  
I am going to name them, something that we rarely do- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sure all hon. members join the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm and the other members of his caucus in recognizing the wonderful job that the pages do.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:
Mr. Speaker, we ask your permission to name the pages so that history will remember them, just as we named the pages who were here before midnight.  
They are Annick, Kaija, Sonya-

Oh, oh.

Mr. Yvan Loubier:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have been voting for thirty hours or so now. 
I just noticed a common practice in this House, namely that the Chair first asks those in favour of the motion to say yea or oui, and then those opposed to say nay or non. 
We realize that this practice gives an undue advantage to the no side, since when we yell yea first, the no side can adjust the level of decibels according to ours.  
We were wondering whether, for the sake of justice, fairness, and democracy- 
Some hon. members:
And clarity.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier: -and for the sake of clarity so dear to our Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and distinguished university professor, the Chair could start with those opposed to the motion and then go to those in favour of the motion for the remainder of the votes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a novel idea. 
Perhaps it is one that would have to go to procedure and House affairs. 
I am having enough trouble keeping things straight as it is. 
I will pay particular attention to the noes, though.
