Prayers 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I believe you would find unanimous consent for the following motion. 
It has been discussed between the leaders of all parties in the House: 
That the hours of sitting and order of business of the House on Thursday, April 29, 1999, shall be those provided in the standing orders for a Wednesday; 
That the address of the President of the Czech Republic, to be delivered in the Chamber of the House of Commons at 10 a.m. on Thursday, April 29, 1999, before members of the Senate and the House of Commons, together with all introductory and related remarks, be printed as an appendix to the House of Commons Debates for that day and form part of the records of this House; and 
That the media recording and transmission of such address, introductory and related remarks be authorized pursuant to established guidelines for such occasions.  
Just to assure all hon. members, this is the identical motion we had for His Excellency President Nelson Mandela with the exception of course that the name of the individual has changed.  
(Motion agreed to) 
* * * 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the 11th report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans which recommends that it be granted leave to travel the week of March 22, 1999 to Nain and Cartwright, Labrador to hold town hall meetings in connection with fisheries issues.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I suggest we defer this item with the permission of the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The document is tabled.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we fully intend to debate this issue and would agree with the government deputy House leader that it could be deferred but we would like to know deferred until when.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
As it stands right now the paper is simply tabled. 
It might arise again depending on what happens under motions. 
At that time it would be dealt with 
Mr. Randy White:
Mr. Speaker, I would like clarification on that. 
Is it the ruling of the Chair that this issue would arise today or any day subsequent to this introduction?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if we could rescind the matter while there are negotiations among the parties and we will deal with the matter forthwith following some consultations with representatives of the official opposition and other parties who might have an interest in the same subject matter.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We may well be getting the cart before the horse. 
The document is merely tabled. 
There is no motion before the House. 
If the member for Miramichi at some future date under motions rises then it would be dealt with at that time, or with notice.  
Mr. Peter Adams:
Mr. Speaker, dealing with this under motions today, or any other day, without consultation with the other parties- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will go to the introduction of government bills.  
* * * 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.) moved for leave to introduce Bill C-68, an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other acts.  
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
* * * 
CANADA WATER EXPORT PROHIBITION ACT 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.) moved for leave to introduce Bill C-485, an act to prohibit the export of water from Canada by pipeline, railway tank car, tank truck, tanker or interbasin transfers.  
Water will be the defining issue of the coming century and the centuries beyond. 
It is the most cherished by Canadians of the values that define our natural heritage. 
The overwhelming desire of Canadians is to protect their water from export. 
The bill simply attempts to do this.  
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
* * * 
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT 
Mr. Speaker, I introduce this bill on behalf of an overwhelming number of my constituents who truly believe a change like this is appropriate. 
Edmonton Centre-East would properly describe this riding in full whereas at the present time the centre of the city of Edmonton to 109th Street is not described by the title of Edmonton East alone. 
The bill has overwhelming support and I am presenting it for that reason.  
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
* * * 
NATIONAL DAY AGAINST IMPAIRED DRIVING ACT 
Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill in the House that will call to the attention of Canadians the need to continue to fight against drunk driving. 
This private member's bill will dedicate August 14 each year in Canada as the national day against impaired driving.  
Each year in our country so many good people are killed or injured by those who deliberately drink and drive. 
This bill will remind us all of our obligation to resolve the problem. 
This bill was inspired by Sharlene Verhulst whose twin sister Cindy was killed by a drunk driver. 
I dedicate the bill to Mark Roffel, Cindy Verhulst, my niece Sheena, a very special person in my life, my niece Krista, and all victims of drunk drivers. 
This bill should be know as Cindy's bill.  
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)

PETITIONS 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition on the matter of human rights signed by a number of Canadians, including some from my own constituency of Mississauga South.  
The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that human rights violations continue to be rampant around the world in countries such as Indonesia. 
They also point out that Canada continues to be recognized as the champion of internationally accepted human rights.  
The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to continue to speak out against human rights violations and to seek to bring to justice those responsible for such abuses.  
VIOLENT OFFENDERS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have another 7,500 names, which makes it now over 21,000 names. 
They would like you to know, Mr. Speaker, that there would be fewer devastating sexual and other assaults if legislative measures would be taken.  
Therefore the petitioners ask that Sumas Community Correctional Centre officials have the right to refuse violent, repeat and dangerous offenders who could pose a danger to society, and that habitual violent offenders and sexual perpetrators should not be allowed to reside at Sumas Community Correctional Centre any longer.  
There are more names coming. 
I urge the House to follow up and follow through on this petition.  
MERCHANT NAVY VETERANS 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish today to present to the House five petitions by hundreds of Canadians who are concerned about merchant navy veterans.  
Their concerns can be basically summarized as seeking war veteran status, prisoner of war benefits, recompense for years of denial of equality, and ceremonial day recognition.  
I submit these petitions today on behalf of merchant navy veterans and their concerns.  
PAY EQUITY 
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people in the riding of Verchères-Les Patriotes, who sincerely believe in equality between men and women and in justice, I have the honour of tabling two petitions, pursuant to Standing Order 36, demanding that the government withdraw its appeal against the public service pay equity decision and give effect to the court ruling in this regard.  
This petition combines with those presented by my other Bloc Quebecois colleagues in the past few days.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to present to the House of Commons, pursuant to Standing Order 36, a petition signed by Canadians who are very concerned that the OECD and the head of the OECD, Don Johnston, are continuing to negotiate a multilateral agreement on investment.  
These Canadians are very concerned about the negative impact an MAI would have on Canada, our economy and jobs in our country in particular. 
They are asking the House of Commons to impose a moratorium on ratification of the MAI and to ask Don Johnston to stop negotiating something that is not wanted by anyone in the country except the large multinational American corporations that support the Liberal government. 
PAY EQUITY 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people in the riding of Charlesbourg, who sincerely believe in equality between men and women and in justice, I have the honour of tabling two petitions pursuant to Standing Order 36, demanding that the government withdraw its appeal against the public service pay equity decision and give effect to the court ruling requiring it to ensure pay equity for its employees.  
This petition combines with those presented by my other Bloc Quebecois colleagues.  
* * * 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is that agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT 
The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-61, an act to amend the War Veterans Allowance Act, the Pension Act, the Merchant Navy Veteran and Civilian War-related Benefits Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act and the Halifax Relief Commission Pension Continuation Act and to amend certain other Acts in consequence thereof, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.  
(Motion agreed to) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
By leave, now? 
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to third reading of Bill C-61 today. 
This omnibus legislation is designed to provide enhanced benefits for Canada's veterans and their survivors. 
It is a tangible expression of our gratitude to these men and women for their service and for their contribution to their country.  
It is not often that members of the House agree on the need for swift passage of legislation. 
Let me at this point express my heartfelt gratitude to all members of the standing committee who saw the need and acted on the need by letting the bill pass through their deliberations with speed and dispatch. 
The fact they have done so is an indication of the high regard we all hold for our veterans.  
They had high hopes for settling down, for starting families and for a bright future, and they loved their country. 
When war came they would surrender their youth and put their hopes, their families and their futures on hold for the love of their country. 
When called upon these young men and women, these ordinary men and women, they would come to do quite extraordinary things and in the process become quite extraordinary themselves.  
When it was all over those who did not die on the field of battle came home to build a nation, and what a nation they built. 
We the generation that followed have known only peace and prosperity for the most of the second half of this century. 
As we are about to enter the new millennium we are the benefactors of the sacrifices of those brave men and women who served in two world wars and in Korea.  
That is why the country made a pact with them which said ``We will remember your sacrifices'', a pact which said ``We will take care of you as you took care of us''. 
That is why over the years we have developed such a comprehensive set of programs that provide disability benefits for those whose injuries and illnesses from service continue to plague them; monetary allowances for those whose life circumstances have left them at the low end of the income scale; comprehensive medical and dental benefits as supplements to provincial plans; and a veterans independence program that allows veterans to stay in their own homes as long as possible and, when that is no longer possible, provides access to long term beds so that their care needs continue to be provided.  
During second reading of the bill I spoke about the progress which has been made in building and improving upon a package of programs and services for veterans which ensures they are able to live as comfortably as possible and with the dignity they so rightly deserve. 
Our challenge now is to make sure that these programs and benefits continue to meet their needs which are changing with the passage of time. 
The bill will do just that.  
Like most omnibus legislation, Bill C-61 is not about making great changes to policy. 
It will generate no great newspaper headlines. 
Rather, it concerns itself with the details that will affect, for the better, the day to day lives of many of our veterans. 
In short, the legislation is another step forward in providing top notch quality care to these men and women and their dependants.  
What does Bill C-61 do for veterans? 
Very briefly, it brings the merchant navy under the same legislation as armed forces veterans and it puts an end to any uncertainty regarding their status as veterans. 
It also opens up the disability pension process so that more widows of veterans might be eligible for an increase in their pension payments. 
More than 35,000 widows fall in this category.  
We are recognizing the special needs of former prisoners of war and affording them the opportunity to receive an attendance allowance to help with their day to day personal care.  
Bill C-61 seeks to defer the deadline for termination of war veterans' allowance payments to allied veterans residing outside Canada. 
In so doing we will remove the possibility of any undue hardship which might be caused by requiring these individuals to return to Canada in order to continue to receive their payments.  
We are also looking for changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs Act to allow for more orderly procedures regarding grave markers and financial assistance for funerals and burials.  
There are proposed changes as well to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act to help smooth the process for the board's hearings and to make the scheduling of these hearings convenient for the board and, more importantly, for the appellant. 
Finally, through the bill we are providing continuing pension payments for those survivors of the terrible explosion in the Halifax harbour in 1917.  
What is also noteworthy about these amendments is that they respond to priorities identified by the main veteran organizations. 
Bill C-61 demonstrates that we are listening and that we are prepared to act. 
Most importantly, it will provide direct improvements for the lives of these most cherished of our citizens.  
I hope we can send another signal to veterans groups by demonstrating that we are prepared to act soon. 
I urge all members of the House to lend their support to this bill. 
We owe it to Canada's veterans by showing them that we care and that we have not forgotten them.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today I wish to speak of Canada's unknown navy, the navy shamefully not found in many of our schools' history textbooks, the navy Canada's young know not of.  
Canada's merchant navy of World War II developed into a force of 12,000 men and women who collectively sailed 25,000 merchant ship voyages. 
Canada's unsung soldiers moved vital war supplies through enemy lines not by mule, not by truck, but by ship at a horrendous cost.  
Young men and women signed up for this service, just as they did for others. 
Restrictions on enlistment were lesser for the merchant navy, allowing the under-age and under-weight to still serve their country with dignity and pride. 
Dedication to service came at a high cost to these brave Canadians and Newfoundlanders. 
The first service causality of the war was with the merchant navy. 
On September 3, 1939, Hannah Baird of Quebec was killed aboard the unarmed vessel SS Athenia when a German submarine sank it.  
To emphasize, as has never been done before in this Chamber, the real price of peace, the real sacrifice to merchant mariners, I would like to make mention of the lost ships. 
Canada's merchant navy was very small in the early days of the war. 
At that time it only consisted of 38 ocean-going vessels. 
By war's end, five years later, that fleet grew to 410 ships. 
Merchant crews were often unarmed and were forced to sail under rough sea conditions to supply the war effort. 
The crews did receive some training, but often that was done on the calm and safe inland waters such as the marine engineering instructional school located in Prescott on Lake Ontario.  
By later 1940 the merchant fleet had grown from 38 vessels, but losses had already claimed eight vessels. 
In 1940 seven ships were lost: the Erik Boyle was torpedoed; the Magog was torpedoed and shelled; the Waterloo was bombed by German aircraft; the Thorold was bombed by German aircraft; the Kenordoc was attacked by submarine gunfire; the St. Malo was torpedoed; and the Trevisa was torpedoed.  
Badly burned, a person would swim until shocked to their death in the cold, oil-topped North Atlantic. 
Other ships in the convoy would do their best to help, but also had to consider their own safety.  
Many veterans say, the worse the weather the better they slept. 
A calm, clear night with a full moon was cause for insomnia. 
A calm evening might end with the engine's monotony shattered by an attack that suddenly turned their world from peace into hell.  
This was all too familiar in 1941 as 13 more ships were lost: the Maplecourt was torpedoed; the Canadian Cruiser was sunk by a raider; the A.D. Huff was sunk by a raider; the J.B. White was torpedoed; the Canadolite was captured by a raider; the Portadoc was torpedoed; the Europa was bombed by German aircraft; the Collingdoc was mined; the Lady Somers was torpedoed; the Vancouver Island was torpedoed; with the Proteus the loss was unknown; the Nereus was another unknown loss; and the Shinai was seized by the Japanese.  
Canadians were not the only ones busy building for all-out war. 
In 1942 the German U-boat fleet grew from 91 to 212. 
This made the situation for the merchant ships deteriorate further. 
The addition of Canadian built, highly manoeuvrable Corvettes to Canadian convoys helped, but losses were still tragically high.  
In 1942 alone 31 ships were lost: the Lady Hawkins was torpedoed; the Montrolite was torpedoed; the Empress of Asia was bombed by Japanese aircraft; the Vicolite was torpedoed and shelled; the George L. Torian was torpedoed; the Lennox was torpedoed; the Sarniadoc was torpedoed; the Robert W. Pomeroy was mined; the Vineland was torpedoed and shelled; the James E. Newsom was shelled; the Lady Drake was torpedoed; the Mildred Pauline was shelled; the Mont Louis was torpedoed; the Calgarolite was torpedoed; the Torondoc was torpedoed; the Troisdoc was torpedoed; the Frank B. Baird was shelled; the Liverpool Packet was torpedoed; the Mona Marie was shelled; the Lucille M. was shelled; the Prescodoc was torpedoed; the Princess Marguerite was torpedoed; the Donald Stewart was torpedoed; the Lord Strathcona was torpedoed; the John A. Holloway was torpedoed; the Oakton was torpedoed; the Norfolk was torpedoed; the Carolus was torpedoed; the Bic Island was torpedoed; the Rose Castle was torpedoed; and the Charles J. Kampmann was also torpedoed.  
These were tremendous losses taken by the merchant navy with their ships sunk out from under them.  
1942 was the year the ongoing battle of the Atlantic continued in earnest. 
German U-boats were infesting Canada's waters. 
Several ships were lost in the St. Lawrence River. 
Concern was at an all time high when even harbour anchorages did not put men's minds to rest. 
The wrath of the German U-boats was felt from the warm Caribbean seas all the way up to the chilly waters of Atlantic Canada.  
As the war went on the Canadian contribution became so much more important. 
Supplies in continental Europe were quickly being depleted and supply lines into Britain were under constant attack. 
At one point it is said that a crisis developed when there existed less than 30 days of stocks and Canada was responsible for bringing the situation back to a manageable level.  
Canada supplied to the war material as no other nation, save the United States, with 17,000 aircraft, 900,000 land vehicles and a million men and women in uniform. 
This truly was a war of material supply. 
Canada contributed raw materials like wood and foodstuffs, but also multitudes of manufactured materials like airplanes, vehicles, tanks, weapons and clothes. 
All of this material was transported by our merchant navy.  
There was no such thing as a typical merchant navy ship. 
Ships of every description were utilized as the need for supplies across the ocean multiplied. 
Many of the vessels used had previous lives in industry before the war erupted. 
Some ships had sailed all the oceans, while others had never left Canadian waters before. 
Some were lakers recruited for war on the high seas. 
The same could be said for their crews.  
Many seamen had high seas experience, but others had never left Atlantic Canada or even the Great Lakes. 
There were men who had sailed the west coast and had never dealt with the threat of icebergs before. 
Despite all of these obstacles, each one of these men was proudly Canadian and knew their lives were not safe on the seas, but they felt a duty to serve king and country.  
Just as there was no typical ship, there was no typical seaman. 
Many of the people in the merchant navy had been working on their respective ships prior to 1939, so they were not the young teenage men we often picture. 
Many had families, children and grandchildren.  
Just as the merchant navy was home to older, seasoned sailors, it was also home to our youngest seamen. 
With the adrenalin of the war effort, men and boys of all ages wanted to serve Canada overseas. 
With manpower in desperate need, many questions were not asked.  
Just as the young could skirt the rules to enter the merchant navy, so could those with health problems and disabilities. 
Many barely missed the cutoff for the armed forces, but driven by patriotic pride they joined the war via the merchant navy.  
Of the 1,500 who died, eight of them were women.  
Many young lives were lost in 1943 when three ships were lost, bringing the total to 54 vessels:
The Angelus was shelled; the Jasper Park was torpedoed; and the Fort Athabasca was blown up.  
As the war progressed many of the sailors had sustained injuries and many had lost a friend or two, if not their entire crew. 
Many wanted to return home to comfort grieving parents and some had not seen their wives for several years.  
The tension of the battle of the Atlantic was several years old, but by 1943 the tide was turning to victory. 
However, losses in 1944 were still triple that of the previous year. 
Mines were taking a greater toll and the threat of enemy aircraft seemed worse, even as the RCAF and RAF began to gain air superiority.  
In 1944 nine more ships came to rest at the ocean bottom: the Fort Bellingham was torpedoed; the Fort St. Nicholas was torpedoed; the Watuka was torpedoed; the Fort Missanabie was torpedoed; the Albert C. Field was torpedoed; the Fort Norfolk was mined; the Nipiwan Park was torpedoed; the Cornwallis was torpedoed; and the Fort Maisonneuve was mined.  
The final year of the war was 1945, but the merchant navy continued its work long after the war's end, delivering humanitarian aid to the citizens of Germany. 
They still ferried supplies required for the rebuilding and restocking of Europe.  
Merchant navy seamen were encouraged to continue on the ships by our government of the day. 
While a few were able to remain aboard the ships, most gradually lost their jobs when the ships were sold to other countries.  
Merchant navy veterans were not entitled to the benefits of other veterans. 
In early 1945 the merchant navy lost another six ships: the Point Pleasant Park was torpedoed; the Soreldoc was torpedoed; the Taber Park was mined; the Silver Star Park was lost in a collision; the Green Hill Park was blown up; and the Avondale Park was torpedoed.  
We must also remember that the ships Watkins F. Nisbett and R.J. Cullen were also lost for unknown reasons on unknown dates. 
If a ship was lost, on average, only 50% of the crew survived.  
Canada's veterans of this global conflict are deserving of our undying gratitude for their service to our country.  
Canadians must recognize fully that our existence and privileges enjoyed today are due not only to the efforts of our veterans, but also to the efforts of their missing comrades throughout the world.  
Few finer examples of Canadian wartime success and magnificent effort can be found than in the annals of the battle of the Atlantic where merchant seamen sailed the enemy infested sea in keeping Allies supplied in World War II.  
Many dedicated individuals have worked to have the merchant navy's concerns addressed. 
Their work will be remembered as part of the lengthy battle for equality.  
I take a moment to pay a personal tribute to a man who has the utmost respect of all veterans and members on both sides of the House. 
Mr. Gordon Olmstead was forced to step back from the frontlines of this battle due to his health but he remains a respected voice among his peers. 
He was a prisoner of war and was instrumental in having this legislation drafted. 
No better tribute could be made than to call this bill the Gordon Olmstead act. 
I am pleased we can have this legislation passed without unreasonable delay.  
Last year I was able to get the agreement of all merchant navy groups on these four points of outstanding concern: to be recognized as war veterans, to receive prisoner of war benefits, to receive compensation for years of denial of equality, and to receive recognition on ceremonial days. 
This legislation will address three of these four points and for this I am very thankful.  
The committee is committed to deliver a report with corrective recommendations to the House before the summer recess. 
Finally we will be able to bring closure to this unfortunate chapter in Canadian history. 
For the first time a formal committee will study the compensation aspect of the years of denial of equality.  
I look forward to bringing closure to this long outstanding issue this year. 
Recompense is the final concern which begs for settlement.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-61. 
This bill amends the War Veterans Allowance Act and certain other acts in consequence thereof.  
It is with respect and honour that I will pursue at third reading the same objective I pursued at second reading, which is to improve the services provided to veterans and their dependents, to ensure the recognition of a unique status for all those who participated in these wars, and to pursue the retroactivity claim for merchant navy veterans.  
Even though the bill is very incomplete, the Bloc Quebecois supports it because it provides benefits to veterans and because, for the first time, those who served in the merchant navy are given the same status as other veterans. 
This legislation is governed by the same acts that recognize the critical role of merchant navy seamen in the victory of the nations that fought for freedom. 
This legislation also puts some order in the various acts that apply to veterans and it ensures a degree of fairness.  
The bill meets the concerns of a number of associations. 
During the debate at second reading, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs announced that the House would respond positively to a key priority of the National Council of Veterans Associations, by allowing former prisoners of war to receive the special allowances. 
He indicated that, in passing these changes, the House would also respond positively to the number one veteran's priority of the Royal Canadian Legion, which is to increase pensions for survivors.  
The merchant marine veterans presented two demands: recognition under the same laws and the benefits they did not receive for the past 50 years retroactively.  
Why is the government denying today what it wanted yesterday? 
The Minister of Veterans Affairs said the following before a committee on April 29, 1998, and I quote: 
I have personal knowledge of this. 
It was the fall of 1991. 
Three members of the opposition, including myself, took it upon ourselves to address what I personally had felt had been an injustice for many, many years, and the other members agreed with me.  
Why did this member, now Minister of Veterans Affairs, not include provision for retroactivity in his bill? 
Is he really serious as he cries over the fate of these veterans?  
On the whole, this bill is intended to correct the anomalies of the past and to include financial compensation, which would repair the deeds of negligence of a previous government. 
That government passed a bill giving numerous benefits to armed forces veterans returning to Canada after World War II, but did not extend these benefits to merchant navy seamen, who volunteered to serve their country.  
In 1992, legislation was tabled to give merchant navy seamen the same benefits to which army veterans are entitled, but not the same status.  
It took 45 years for the role played by merchant navy seamen to be recognized and the same benefits, but not the same status, to be extended to them. 
Now they are being given the same status as members of the armed forces, but not the retroactive benefits of which they have been deprived all these years. 
Their demands are slowly being met. 
However, the average age of these veterans is 75.  
Thus the bill is incomplete, since it does not accept retroactivity of the rights now recognized for merchant seamen back to the time they joined the battle. 
They have been deprived of 50 years of benefits. 
They have suffered all their lives because of this refusal.  
Unlike other veterans, they never had the advantage of financial assistance for trade training or university. 
They never had priority for public service hiring, they never had access to land, housing or business funding.  
At one of the committee hearings, a witness told us that most merchant seamen would discuss their post-war experiences amongst themselves, but hesitated to do so publicly, because they felt ashamed, although they were wrong to feel this way. 
They felt it was their fault that they could not support their families the way their fellow Canadians who had been in uniform could, with the help of government subsidies.  
Yet they too were in the line of fire. 
In 1941, the monster Adolph Hitler issued the following order: ``Attack the merchant marine, particularly on the return route, with all possible means. 
Sinking merchant marine vessels is more important than attacking enemy warships''.  
The merchant seamen were exposed to dreadful working conditions and heavy loss of life. 
They sustained more losses than any other Canadian combat forces. 
These brave Canadians, who plied the corridors of hell, played a vital role in our war effort, one as vital as that played by the regular forces, and one that is recognized throughout the world.  
It would appear from the strong support the public gave the former merchant marines who organized a hunger strike on Parliament Hill, that they do not support the longstanding government negligence in this matter.  
The government has fallen short of its responsibilities and of the justice required by the sacrifices these men have made, because from the outset, it could have included retroactivity in this bill.  
However, he is untouched by their great suffering, especially their mental suffering.  
At second reading of this bill, all the opposition parties called for either retroactivity or a lump sum payment to replace the benefits they did not receive after serving their country. 
Only the Liberal government remains intractable.  
Great Britain gave full veteran status to the merchant marine seamen in 1940. 
In the United States, merchant navy veterans gained the same status as regular forces veterans in 1988, while Australia recognized full equality in 1995. 
Here in Canada, they had to wait until 1992 to get the same benefits, but not retroactively.  
In 1993, the government decided to improve its image by inviting a few merchant navy veterans to participate in a pilgrimage to Liverpool, to commemorate the battle of the Atlantic. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs said, at second reading of this bill, and I quote: 
I want to assure members that merchant navy veterans are veterans in every sense of the word and this bill underscores that fact. 
By using the same acts to respond to the needs of both merchant navy and armed forces veterans we send a powerful signal that we value the service and sacrifice performed by the merchant navy during the wars.  
If this intention and this assurance are real, why did the government not recognize the mistake made in this bill, apologize and make the whole thing retroactive?  
Members will agree with me that Canadian merchant navy veterans can no longer wait: they have already been waiting for over 50 years. 
In addition to social benefits and disability pensions, they need a compensation package. 
Does the government have the necessary money?  
An examination of the amounts not spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs over a 15-year period shows that it is not for lack of money that merchant navy seamen are not being compensated.  
A total of $887,960,424 was not spent. 
Merchant navy seamen are asking for approximately $40 million.  
This bill could have restored this unspent money. 
For reasons unknown, the government put these funds into general revenue, as it does with the EI surpluses, cuts in provincial transfer payments, and unpaid commitments to Quebec. 
In this regard, the following amounts are owed to Quebec: $435 million for Hydro-Québec towers after the ice storm; $58.7 million for the Palais des congrès de Montréal; $33.6 million for the Oka crisis; $70 million for day care centres; $86.7 million for young offenders; $351.4 million for social assistance. 
And I could go on and on. 
Today the federal government is going to invest billions of dollars on window-dressing to create havoc and create duplication just to improve its image.  
Nevertheless, in 1993, merchant marine veterans agreed to join with armed forces veterans in a visit to Liverpool to commemorate the Battle of the Atlantic.  
Last year, they were again part of the delegation to commemorate that battle, and were also along on the pilgrimage to mark the 50th anniversary of various World War II battles and campaigns 
I was also there. 
The Army veterans' recognition and respect for the merchant seamen was obvious. 
The merchant seamen showed no bitterness. 
Why are they still being refused what they are entitled to, 50 years later?  
They make it look good. 
But all this show does not, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, do much for the merchant marine veterans. 
As we saw last summer, right here in front of the Parliament Buildings, it just leads to hunger strikes and to despair.  
Is it not this minister's mandate to provide veterans, civilians and their families with the benefits and services to which they are entitled, in order to ensure their well-being and self-sufficiency within the community and to ensure that all Canadians remember their accomplishments and their sacrifices?  
Was it ensuring their well-being and self-sufficiency, was it fulfilling the governments' mandate in this respect to refuse the same benefits and services to which merchant seamen were entitled retroactively, right up until 1992? 
And what about that other responsibility, of ensuring that all Canadians remember that war? 
The people of Europe and Asia, who lived through it, already do remember.  
What happens in these former theatres of war in Europe or in Asia when a whole contingent of youth and invited guests turns up? 
Most of the time, a handful of local people attend. 
I think these veterans should be allowed to return once in their life to a theatre of war accompanied by a relative. 
But at the moment, it is pretty much always the same people who go on these trips: the deputy minister and his team.  
Why not establish a real national day of remembrance in Canada? 
It is Canadians we should be informing and involving. 
We should open Parliament the entire day to school children and veterans with their relatives, their MP and their minister and take the evening to remember those who were lost. 
In my opinion, providing documentaries to the media is a means of keeping alive the memory of their dedication. 
Having a real day of respect, of thanks and of commemoration. 
This first day could be devoted to the members of the merchant marine to compensate for the error of the past.  
In committee, I introduced an amendment that was ruled out of order. 
However, included in the bill, it would have resolved the problem once and for all. 
It read as follows: 
All payments of allowance or other benefits under the Pension Act or the War Veterans Allowance Act in respect of a merchant navy veteran of World War I or World War II or a Canadian merchant navy veteran of the Korean War are payable for a period beginning on the day on which that veteran would have otherwise first become entitled to the payment if the provisions of this Act had been in force on the date of commencement of World War I, World War II or the Korean War, as the case may be.  
I once again call on the government so that the members of the merchant marine may obtain justice and the reparation of past errors through retroactive redress or a lump sum payment.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my New Democratic colleagues in support of Bill C-61.  
As veterans affairs spokesperson for the federal NDP, I am pleased that part of the stain on the record of how Canada treats its veterans has been removed. 
This bill should become law so that in word and from now on in deed merchant mariners will be treated as full equals to other Canadian veterans instead of being relegated to the margins of Canada's official military history.  
These brave Canadians played a central role in Canada's war efforts. 
While many of those whom we remember and honour today are those who served in the regular military, we must not forget the many others who served their country in a unique yet very important way, either as special construction battalions or merchant marines.  
I am pleased to once again take the opportunity to commend the merchant marine veterans, their organizations, families, activists and supporters for bringing this bill into being. 
Without their tireless and for the most part thankless work, we would not be discussing this bill today.  
What happened to the Canadian merchant mariners upon their return to Canada? 
They were denied health support and employment opportunities available to army, navy and air force personnel.  
I am proud to support Bill C-61 which declares as law the equal status of merchant navy veterans with regular forces veterans.  
The issue of compensation, one of paramount importance, remains a dark blotch on our record.  
This government saw fit to provide an ex gratia payment of $23,940 each to Hong Kong veterans who were Japanese prisoners of war. 
This payment was promised last December. 
It strikes me as at least an effort to achieve a just settlement.  
As mentioned earlier in my comments, it is a disgrace that this government has betrayed Canada's merchant mariners by refusing to compensate them for the discrimination that the merchant mariners faced upon their return home from serving Canada's war efforts. 
It has been estimated that merchant mariners are dying at the rate of about 12 per month.  
On November 24, 1998 in response to a question I put to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, the minister said concerning compensation negotiations for merchant mariners ``I am there to listen''. 
I already mentioned earlier that debating Bill C-61 before this House signals a time to act. 
Justice delayed is justice denied, particularly when the death rate among these veterans who served Canada so nobly is so high.  
The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs is slated to explore this compensation issue after the passage of Bill C-61. 
Assuming that the committee comes forth with a recommendation, I worry a bit that the government will then take its time to respond and make an announcement. 
How many more honourable Canadian merchant mariners must die before the Liberal government does the right thing and provides just compensation?  
Even today as I am speaking I am reminded of Mr. Gordon Olmstead who has fought long and hard on this issue and is currently in the hospital dying of cancer. 
It is just a matter of time probably, unless the good Lord sees otherwise. 
From where the New Democratic members sit, one more death before proper compensation is provided is one too many.  
Further to this point, it is high time that the government supported improvements in the health care package available to all veterans, particularly those at a venerable and often vulnerable age.  
I sincerely hope that the spirit of justice in Bill C-61 has an effect on the government's treatment of other Canadian veterans. 
What about Canada's aboriginal veterans? 
First nations men and women served their country well alongside non-native forces personnel despite the fact that when World War II ended, they were not allowed to vote or even own their own land.  
Many first nations veterans were never told they were entitled to educational opportunities or that they were able to purchase land at a cheap price. 
Some even returned to Canada to learn that their reserve lands had been seized by the federal government to compensate non first nations veterans.  
I also think in particular of the Canadian veterans who were wrongly sent as prisoners of war to the Buchenwald concentration camp by Hitler and the Nazis. 
This government disgraced those brave Canadians when they were sent cheques for $1,098 to compensate them for the horrors they faced in the concentration camp, horrors which are in some cases relived in the minds of these veterans over and over again.  
Our Liberal government has failed miserably where so many other governments have succeeded. 
I hope the spirit of Bill C-61 has some effect on the government so that it moves to ensure the Buchenwald survivors find the justice they so richly deserve.  
I am indeed pleased that this bill provides for the continuation of disability pensions for victims of the 1917 Halifax explosion. 
As the member of parliament for Halifax West, I am all too well aware of the horror of that tragedy and the pain, death and destruction it wreaked.  
I am also pleased this bill clarifies which merchant navy veterans of the Korean War will be eligible for benefits.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my support to the third reading and passage of Bill C-61. 
This bill is something that many of our merchant navy veterans have been looking forward to for many years.  
I will never forget the day. 
I was only a little girl, about seven years old. 
I remember my uncle who was shot in the first world war, and we thank God that he lived through that, telling me, ``Put on your very best dress, dear. 
We are going to the train station for the boys are coming home''.  
The veterans are very dear to my heart. 
The first real legislation to deal with the Canadian merchant navy was brought in in 1992 by the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, by the Hon. Gerald Merrithew who was the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
At that time, omnibus Bill C-84 was brought in with an additional $100 million of funding to be allocated directly to the merchant navy and their claims. 
The bill brought in by my former colleagues was not perfect but it was a huge step in the right direction.  
The reality of this legislation is that it took this administration six years to address the concerns of the veterans with the original legislation.  
Bill C-61 will make changes to address some of the biases merchant navy veterans have faced when applying for benefits. 
By placing them under the coveted War Veterans Allowance Act, it puts an end to the cross-referencing each of the merchant navy veterans was subjected to when applying for benefits.  
This I am sure will please many of the veterans as it now means that they will qualify for benefits they should have been receiving since World War II. 
Great Britain recognized the merchant navy men as the fourth arm of its services at the beginning of World War II and they received all the same benefits as other members of the armed forces.  
It will also provide an additional $8 million to address the needs of those merchant navy veterans who were prisoners of war and be used to assist those who were widowed.  
My heart goes out to all those across this nation who lost a loved one in the line of duty and to those who died later due to the complications of war related service, the soldiers who gave their lives, the air force men, the navy and our merchant navy men, so that all Canadians from Victoria to St. John's, Newfoundland could enjoy the freedom we have today. 
A large part of the war effort was filled by the bravery and tenacity of the Canadian merchant navy.  
To all the merchant navy veterans who are listening today, many from across the country waiting to see what will happen with Bill C-61, I want to say thank you.  
Is it enough for us to just say thank you, knowing what we know to be true and how the merchant navy was treated after World War II? 
How they must have felt, each and every one of them, as they watched their counterparts receive many benefits.  
The counterparts should have received benefits, but they were benefits the merchant navy men never received. 
Imagine serving your country well, with pride and dignity, and returning after the war you see your counterpart who was on the same boat with you given everything and you are given nothing. 
How would you feel? 
You would feel hurt. 
You would feel let down. 
Some of those men come into my office with tears in their eyes. 
Their wives, as well, get in touch with me. 
It has been 54 years that they have been fighting for equality.  
The question remains whether we, as a country, owe these men something. 
I believe the answer we would hear from most Canadians is yes.  
Why would people feel this way? 
People today are well informed. 
After the hunger strike held here by some of the merchant navy veterans last fall, Canadians from coast to coast took the time to become more informed.  
They know these veterans were not really paid a high premium for their service. 
A privy council document from 1941 showed that these men were not to be paid any higher than a sailor in the navy. 
This certainly dispels the myth that they were paid a higher wage and therefore should not receive any compensation.  
The reality of the post-war era for merchant navy men was that they were the big losers after the war. 
A video has been made by Mr. Cliff Chadderton, president of the National Council of Veterans Associations in Canada, entitled Sail or Jail .  
I have a copy in my office and when I watched the video it truly brought tears to my eyes. 
I do not know how Cliff was able to do this video but it shows when they were torpedoed. 
It shows when they were in the water and it shows them dying. 
It is there. 
I will share the video with any of my colleagues in the House if they want to see it. 
It quickly becomes apparent in watching Sail or Jail what the merchant navy lost. 
One of eight merchant navy men was lost at sea.  
They were also given education assistance, trades training, disability treatment, land grant opportunities and waiting returns allowances. 
I am pleased and proud that we gave these to them.  
What was offered to merchant navy men? 
They were given hope as the government of the day talked about developing and maintaining the merchant navy. 
This is difficult to say but if we look at the history of the merchant navy, it appears that the government of the day did not want to pay benefits to these men so they were not given the opportunity to be part of the demobilization effort of the government. 
They were kept busy cleaning up the seaways.  
After the troops were demobilized the boats they worked on were sold. 
I had great concerns this week when I saw in the estimates tabled that $1 million was to be taken from the veterans independence program. 
I thank the parliamentary secretary for responding and telling us no, $1 million will not be taken from the veterans independence program because they need it.  
Think about it, 54 years. 
Think of how old these men are today. 
They cannot go out and shovel. 
They cannot do the cleaning that has to be done. 
They cannot do the cleaning within the home. 
They need that part time service. 
We do not want them to be totally independent.  
I am proud to be a Canadian. 
I do not think anyone would question that. 
When I think of how these men were treated after the war I get very angry inside and a bit ashamed. 
However, there is hope.  
The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs is about to begin to study the issue of compensation. 
The findings of this study will then be turned over to the government for a response. 
I want to make it perfectly clear. 
There are all kinds of rumours out there that the merchant navy is looking for a great big lump sum payment. 
According to Cliff Chadderton, some would get $5,000. 
Is that not a big lump sum payment? 
I think the maximum was perhaps $30,000, although for very few of them.  
I am told that every month we lose probably six or more of our merchant navy men across this country. 
There may be around 2,000 still living today.  
I feel very strongly when I look at the fact that we have had lapsed funds in our veterans affairs that have not been used. 
The money is there. 
We can do this. 
We can give these men back their dignity. 
Like many Canadians, I hope the response given is in favour of the Canadian merchant navy request for compensation. 
It would not stop the years of pain felt by those widows who could not apply for benefits to help them along the way and it would not turn back the clock, but it would help ease the pain through the simple act of recognition of service to their country, not just through simple words of kindness but through a payment of some sort to say thank you for what you have done.  
I know many of my colleagues on the government side agree with me. 
I thank today the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs for his assistance and his help. 
When we went to him when the men were on Parliament Hill on a hunger strike he said he would meet with them and he did. 
They appreciated it. 
He came to my riding. 
He sat down with them. 
That is what we need, that kind of dialogue to get the understanding we need. 
I thank him very much today.  
I also thank the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the other committee members from all parties who have been working together to put this study in place and making Bill C-61 hopefully unanimous today when we vote.  
It is our role and the role of all those on the government side to tell all of those merchant navy men today that we support them, to stand up for what is right and proceed forward with compensation after the study is referred back to the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
Some hon. members:
Question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed)

NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour for me to launch the debate on Bill C-66, an act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. 
First I congratulate the Minister of Public Works and Government Services who is responsible for CMHC for providing us with such a progressive and balanced piece of legislation.  
Indeed Bill C-66 will simplify the National Housing Act by removing unnecessary restrictions, enabling CMHC to respond quickly to the needs of Canadians and to opportunities in an ever changing market.  
Since it was created over 50 years ago, CMHC has made an unparalleled contribution to help house Canadians. 
Over the years it has been involved in every aspect of housing from building units to direct financing, urban planning, mortgage insurance and now trade development.  
The achievements of CMHC have benefited the country. 
Many of our own families and communities have been helped. 
Through partnerships with all levels of government, community organizations and the private sector, CMHC works to allow Canadians to obtain the shelter they need.  
The government also works on a number of fronts to assist low income Canadians and the homeless. 
One important tool is the CMHC's renovation programs which have provided assistance to low income Canadians for over 20 years. 
The funds provide help to repair unhealthy and unsafe homes. 
They help to upgrade accommodations for the homeless, or for those at risk of becoming homeless, and to modify units for persons with disabilities.  
Other CMHC initiatives such as Homegrown Solutions and the Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing are fostering community based initiatives that address the problem of affordable housing, some of which are specifically directed at serving the needs of low income people.  
All members will agree that we want to ensure the benefits provided to past generations of Canadians will continue to be available to future generations. 
Passing the legislation will help ensure that Canadians continue to have access to housing, have a choice of housing and benefit from new housing research.  
The benefits of the bill are threefold. 
First, Canadians will benefit from these changes because CMHC will be able to respond to shifts in consumer demand and market conditions. 
They will also benefit from the availability of low cost funds and access to mortgage financing, no matter where they live in Canada.  
Third, CMHC will be able to provide better service to all Canadians.  
In recent years CMHC has been approached to support many new and innovative products. 
Unfortunately under the current National Housing Act the CMHC has not been able to bring the benefits of some of these new types of home financing products to our marketplace.  
With these amendments CMHC will have the flexibility to consider products such as insurance for a reverse equity mortgage enabling older homeowners to use the equity in their homes to obtain funds currently while allowing them to continue to live in their homes.  
The CMHC would also be able to develop non-mortgage financing for remote areas where the land registry system does not facilitate mortgages. 
It would also include similar financing arrangements on Indian reserves where restrictions exist on providing land as security for mortgages.  
The corporation would also be able to ensure a greater variety of financing options for the housing rental industry. 
Another benefit is that the CMHC will be able to respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand and market conditions with new and innovative home financing products.  
With these legislative changes Canadians for generations to come will have access to the benefits of public mortgage insurance. 
By giving CMHC the means to better manage its business, these amendments will ensure that CMHC's mortgage insurance activities remain competitive while being managed in a financially responsible manner. 
With this new legislation the CMHC will be able to respond quickly to changes in domestic and international markets as well as to organizations looking to use Canadian housing expertise.  
The legislation will greatly enhance the government's ability to better promote the products and services of our Canadian housing industry abroad. 
To illustrate this point, I will use the minister's own participation in last fall's trade mission to Chile. 
Thirty housing industry representatives joined him on that mission. 
The delegation was made up of provincial and territorial governments, builders, manufactured housing suppliers, products and services providers, and urban planners. 
The members for the ridings of Kelowna and Québec also participated in the trade mission. 
The minister was pleased to lead this group of entrepreneurs and officials, successfully opening doors to Canadian exporters in this important Latin American market.  
Through CMHC's market development programs and services it is anticipated that within one year following the mission this group of exporters will have generated over $35 million in new business, which translates into direct economic benefits to all Canadians.  
Two more trade missions are planned for Korea and Germany in May and October 1999. Similar public-private sector collaborations have recently been undertaken with Poland and Germany. 
This is what I mean when I say the legislation will help the CMHC create job opportunities for Canadians here and abroad.  
Consumers in the housing industry, indeed taxpayers of Canada, all stand to benefit from these amendments which will result in a modernized and more efficient approach to housing. 
The corporation's greatest strength has been its ability to identify and respond to emerging needs.  
Such initiatives are developed either by CMHC on its own or in partnership with other governments or the private sector. 
CMHC either moves once the private sector players have developed the ability to take on the challenge or becomes part of the ongoing solution.  
The amendments that are presented today will build on CMHC's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and help the corporation to carry out the government's vision for the future of housing.  
Earlier I mentioned that these amendments reflect our government's priorities. 
This is demonstrated in several ways. 
For example, one of our government's top priorities is its commitment to stimulating job creation and economic growth. 
We are proud of the fact that more than 1.6 million new jobs have been created since the government was elected in 1993. 
However we want to do more. 
We know that the housing sector is a key component of the economy, with considerable job creation potential. 
For every $100 million spent on construction, 1,500 person years of employment are created both directly and indirectly. 
Behind every construction worker many other workers are producing the materials needed to build a home.  
Clearly the objectives of the housing industry and the government's goals of expanding international trade and stimulating economic growth are one and the same.  
Canada's international reputation for excellence in housing technology helps to open doors to the Canadian housing industry in many foreign markets.  
The corporation has helped foster that reputation through international representation and research. 
Now, through the Canadian Housing Export Centre, CMHC continues to play a key role in supporting the efforts of Canadian housing firms to market their products and their expertise abroad.  
CMHC has also been a leader in helping to establish and research new building practices. 
As we can see, CMHC is helping our government turn its commitments into action in a wide variety of areas.  
The amendments proposed in the bill will enable the corporation to continue these achievements by providing it with the tools it needs to move forward with its expanded role. 
At the same time the corporation will be able to ensure the long term viability of its mortgage loan insurance function.  
Millions of Canadian families bought their first home thanks to the insurance program. 
In fact, one in three Canadian homebuyers have been helped by CMHC in this way. 
Through the bill we want to ensure that future generations of Canadians can continue to benefit from this service.  
As one of Canada's oldest crown corporations, CMHC has always been a pioneer. 
As such, it has introduced government to a new way of delivering services. 
At the same time CMHC's core mission is not all that different from what it was 10 or even 50 years ago. 
Through the legislation the corporation will be able to continue to do what it has always done and will be able to do it well.  
The bill to amend CMHC is part of the government's broader efforts to modernize government operations and ensure the efficient use of taxpayers dollars while improving services to clients.  
CMHC will continue its most important basic function which is to help provide homes for Canadians. 
I encourage all members of the House to support the legislation and enable the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to carry on with its work well into the new millennium.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
There a consequential amendment to another act.  
I couch my remarks with regard to the bill in terms of some questions I would like to ask. 
Are they consistent with effectiveness, in other words reaching the goal or the purpose more effectively? 
What are the financial costs? 
What are the economic costs? 
What about the quality of life?  
These are the questions I wish to address. 
Within that context I would like to refer to some discussions we have had with the officials of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
They have indicated rather clearly that the policy of the government is the object of what Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does. 
Its purpose is to implement the government's policy on housing. 
The details of that policy are in fact contained in the corporate plan.  
I will refer to the corporate plan for 1998 to 2002, in which the mandate for CMHC is stated as follows: 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) is Canada's national housing agency. 
CMHC's specific authorities in housing are embodied in the National Housing Act (NHA). 
The NHA provides CMHC with a range of authorities and tools to address the housing and related needs of Canadians. 
These tools can be grouped under four main headings: housing finance, assisted housing, research and information transfer, and international activities.  
In early 1995, CMHC's mandate in the area of housing research and information transfer was reaffirmed by the Treasury Board of Canada. 
Later that year, the government determined that CMHC should be given the authority to sell products and services in support of housing exports. 
In the 1996 federal budget, the government announced its intention to operate the mortgage insurance fund (IMF) and the mortgage backed securities guarantee fund (MBSGF) on a more commercial basis. 
At that same time, the government also announced that it was prepared to offer the provinces and territories the opportunity to take over the management of the existing federal social housing resources.  
Is that not an interesting way of saying we are getting out of the business? 
In other words, we do not want it any more and will download it to the provinces. 
The government did not consult with the provinces. 
It simply said that it would not do it any more and in fact cut their funding. 
I will have more to say on that later. 
The plan continued: 
Amendments to the NHA and CMHC Act are required to implement aspects of CMHC's new mandate.  
The changes to CMHC's mandate have significant implications for the way the corporation will conduct its business in the future, necessitating changes to current products, structures and processes. 
The mission, vision and core value statements on the following page were developed by CMHC to reflect the new mandate.  
We will stop there for the moment and indicate that the legislation before us today, March 11, 1999, follows the introduction of the corporate plan which clearly indicates what the direction will be.  
Where is CMHC right now? 
I would like to go into some details as well. 
They too come from the corporate plan. 
With regard to mortgage loan insurance it stated: 
Under the mortgage loan insurance program, CMHC provides insurance against borrower default on residential mortgages in consideration of a premium. 
Through default insurance, borrowers with down payments as low as 5% have access to mortgage financing at terms and conditions comparable to those with much greater equity. 
Financial transactions and mortgage loan insurance are recorded in the Mortgage Insurance Fund (IMF).  
This is very useful for many young people or people with lower incomes that have not been able to accumulate a down payment of sufficient size. 
It is a wonderful program. 
That is what it is doing. 
It continued: 
For 1997, mortgage insurance volumes were on track with more than 442,000 units.... 
Insurance-in-force was expected to reach $152 billion by the end of the year. 
Under the NHA, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans for which insurance policies are issued had previously been limited to $150 billion.  
It could not go beyond the $150 billion.  
The Corporation received a $50 billion increase to the ceiling in the fall of 1997.  
In other words it was increased to $200 billion. 
It is very interesting that the bill does not change that. 
This is an interesting development. 
The corporation is running the show. 
At the end of 1996, the MIF was in a surplus position of $18.1 million. 
A loss before taxes of $23.8 million was forecast at mid-year 1997, compared to a $76.1 million before tax income projected in the original 1997 plan. 
This decline in 1997 is attributed to an increase in claim expenses. 
By the end of 1997, the Fund was expected to have a small surplus.  
In mid-1997, Treasury Board approved a policy whereby CMHC will make annual payments to the government for its backing of the Mortgage Insurance Fund.  
This is interesting. 
In 1996 it had a profit. 
In 1997 it looked like it was barely going to have a profit, but in 1997 Treasury Board said that it now had to pay it because it had access to the consolidated revenue fund.  
As well, CMHC will begin to fund the additional policy reserves required by private mortgage insurance by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) imposed on the private sector. 
This applies to new commercial mortgage insurance business initiated after 1996.  
What is beginning to develop with CMHC is very interesting. 
It is no longer simply a crown corporation. 
Legally it is, but it is entering into direct competition with the financial institutions. 
I will explain that a little later. 
It goes so far as to put itself under the same kind of guidelines and provisions that OSFI imposes upon other financial institutions, particularly federally registered trust companies, banks and so on. 
That is one area.  
CMHC is also involved in mortgage backed securities.  
Through the Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS) program, CMHC provides a guarantee of timely payment on securities based on qualifying pools of NHA-insured mortgages. 
Financial transactions for the MBS program are recorded in the Mortgage-backed Securities Guarantee Fund (MBSGF).  
The year-end surplus was expected to increase to $36.6 million.  
The mortgage backed securities business expands beyond NHA mortgages or guaranteed mortgages. 
There is an MBS guaranteed fund but there are also other mortgage backed securities. 
As we go along, we will find that CMHC now wants to get into mortgage backed securities that are not NHA guaranteed mortgages. 
It is getting into direct competition with the private enterprise sector; a crown corporation is getting into competition.  
Let us go into other areas. 
Canada Mortgage and Housing gets into assisted housing.  
Unilaterally or in partnership with the provinces and territories, CMHC subsidizes, on behalf of the federal government, more than 656,000 units of social housing. 
The portfolio is operated through long-term administrative and funding arrangements between CMHC and the provinces and territories, and between CMHC and locally-based housing organizations.  
The federal government announced a new On-Reserve housing policy in 1996. 
Throughout 1997, CMHC has been phasing in the policy. 
This involves the conversion of the existing NHA Section 95 non-profit Housing Program into a full-subsidy program, and First Nations' capacity development to help them take on responsibility for the housing in their communities.  
To reduce overlap and streamline existing administrative arrangements in social housing, CMHC began negotiations in 1996 to transfer to the provinces and territories the management of existing federal resources, with the exception of housing programs for Aboriginal people living on-reserves. 
The Government of Canada will continue to honour its long-term funding commitments to social housing (currently $1.9 billion per year).  
In fact it is just under $2 billion. 
In 1997, agreements were signed with Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories to get out of social housing. 
This is very interesting. 
This theme will develop as we go along here. 
What is happening here is significant.  
CMHC today is also involved internationally. 
I was one of the participants in that trade venture. 
It was a good one. 
I commend the way in which it was conducted. 
Some good things are happening in that area.  
That is a different issue altogether. 
But the real question is, is this a proper function of a crown corporation?  
There are other initiatives.  
From time to time, CMHC is called upon to administer short-term housing initiatives linked to federal policy priorities. 
The 1997 Federal Budget included funding of $51.9 million for 1997 short-term initiatives linked to job creation, including $50 million for the continuation of the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP), the Emergency Repair Program (ER), Home Adaptations for Seniors Independence (HASI), and the Shelter Enhancement Initiative (SEI) for victims of family violence. 
An additional $1.9 million was included in ongoing annual funding for the SEI. 
In total, assistance for an estimated 12,868 units was delivered under these initiatives in 1997.  
The corporate account is another area.  
CMHC is a large mortgage and loan administrator as a result of activities in support of various housing programs. 
Including its land holdings, CMHC's asset portfolio is currently $15 billion.  
The Corporation's profits are the result of the margin on its financing operations and gains on the disposal of land. 
In addition, CMHC offers services to government departments and agencies on a cost-plus basis in areas such as land development, inspections and appraisals, and mortgage administration.  
We begin to see the intricate web that is being woven as to the involvement and then the extrication and involvement again in all kinds of affairs. 
That is what it is now.  
Although the federal government built some housing for World War I veterans, the groundwork for a federal housing agency was not laid until 1935, with the creation of the Dominion Housing Act. 
By 1938 the act had helped finance almost 5,000 housing units.  
The federal government responded in 1946 by creating Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC. 
That was the beginning. 
That is why it was created.  
CMHC built thousands of housing units for veterans, but from the beginning the corporation's mandate was to improve housing for all Canadians. 
In 1954 the corporation began insuring mortgage loans made by private investors. 
The Bank Act was amended to allow Canada's chartered banks to lend money for mortgages, and the amount of mortgage funds available to consumers quickly increased.  
Small surprise. 
There is no risk left for the lending institution if it is guaranteed by a crown corporation. 
Why would the financial institution not increase the amount of money available?  
In the 1950s CMHC focused on improving the quality as well as the quantity of Canadian housing. 
The 1960s brought an emphasis on redeveloping inner cities, while new CMHC programs in the 1970s worked to maintain and improve existing communities. 
Since the 1980s the corporation has given priority to environmental concerns, sustainable communities and the housing needs of native peoples, the elderly and disabled.  
There are other dimensions but before going into them I want to focus attention on the purpose and intent of the National Housing Act. 
It is very short. 
The housing act states very simply that it is ``an act to promote the construction of new houses, the repair and modernization of existing houses, and the improvement of housing and living conditions''. 
That is it.  
We all know that adequate shelter for all households has long been a social goal of federal, provincial and municipal governments in Canada.  
Although housing is within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of property and civil rights, or matters of a merely local or private nature, since the 1937 passage of the National Housing Act, the federal government has played a major role in its provision, mainly through the federal spending power.  
In 1946 the federal government established the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
Since then, CMHC has carried out the federal government's commitment to provide Canadians with equal access and opportunity to suitable, adequate and affordable shelter in safe, healthy environments. 
It also means encouraging self-sufficiency in the private housing market through support to financial markets and to the housing industry.  
Social housing ranges from single detached family homes to townhouses, walkups and apartments. 
It includes rental units owned and managed by the government, non-profit units owned and operated by community and charitable organizations, co-op housing units, units provided for aboriginal peoples on and off reserve, and privately owned units subsidized by governments and rented to low income people.  
Of the social housing portfolio which had CMHC assistance in 1990, over 34% was public housing, 24% was non-profit housing and close to 21% was low rental housing. 
The balance entailed co-op housing, 8%; rental supplements, 7%; and aboriginal housing, 6%.  
I am reading from paper No. 8 by R. E. Jenness, published on March 23, 1994. 
There is also a historic federal and provincial partnership here. 
Until the mid 1960s, government housing projects entailed relatively minor expenditures. 
There was a small public housing program under which capital costs and operating costs were shared on a 75/25 federal-provincial basis, and a small limited dividend program creating privately owned housing units to rent at slightly less than market rates.  
As the 1970s progressed, CMHC expanded and diversified its programs. 
The upshot was a de-emphasis on high density public housing projects and increased reliance upon the following.  
One, a non-profit and co-operative housing program, fully federally funded, that provided an ongoing subsidy to sponsoring organizations, including urban native sponsors, and added new units to the stock of social housing.  
I raise these points because this is the area the federal government is getting out of.  
Two, a federal-provincial rent supplement program, cost shared equally with the provinces that subsidized units in private buildings for rent geared to income clients.  
Three, a residential rehabilitation assistance program, fully federally funded, that made loans, partly forgivable, to homeowners, landlords or non-profit groups to undertake repairs and alterations. 
The minister announced that the program was to come to an end. 
He recently announced there would be an infusion of money into that program again so it will continue.  
Four, a rural and native housing program, mostly cost shared, 75% federal and 25% provincial, to provide new housing and renovation assistance for low income native and non-native people in rural areas.  
Indeed, during the 1970s and early 1980s the federal government along with the provinces, municipalities and community groups steadily increased their collective commitment to social housing. 
According to the Canadian housing coalition, construction of new social housing units rose from 110,213 in 1971-75 to 185,000 in 1981-85.  
In 1986 after a task force report and consultations with the provinces, new directions were taken on social housing. 
The lead responsibility for delivering the programs was in most cases given to the provinces. 
That is really the issue here. 
They were given the lead. 
Also, they are extremely capable of doing that.  
I want to look at one of the most recent developments that I was very cognizant of shortly after I took over the lead critic role in this area. 
It has to do with co-op housing.  
There are many different kinds of co-op housing but two basic ones, those that are federally operated and those that are provincial.  
The federal government said the provincial ones are not its concern but the federal ones are. 
It wanted to download this. 
Then the association of federal co-op housing got a load of this and thought if this is to be downloaded, it is afraid it will lose its co-operative status. 
Lo and behold, enough pressure was created that the minister changed his mind. 
He said that federal co-op housing would stay where it is.  
There are two kinds of co-op housing. 
One I really like is equity co-op housing. 
They have the pride of ownership, the involvement and this is a good thing. 
It would be great if all social housing had some kind of pride of co-operative ownership. 
We all want this.  
It is about a 50:50 split.  
The province of Ontario has downloaded much of this to the municipalities. 
It is very interesting that I came across a study that I am sure members are aware of or have seen. 
It is the report of the mayor's homelessness action task force entitled ``Taking Responsibility for Homelessness:
An Action Plan for Toronto''.  
They talk about specific strategies for high risk subgroups, families with children.  
There has been a dramatic increase. 
Some of these shelters are being populated to a large degree now by families. 
I do not think I have time to get into some of the statistics but they are very revealing.  
What about the health component in all this?  
We are talking about homeless people but we are dealing with more than simply not having a house: an overview of existing services, removing barriers to health care, mental illness and homelessness, addictions and concurrent disorders, and the whole area of supportive housing. 
The report goes into affordable housing and the case for public investment, lessons from our past, producing new low income housing, preserving existing affordable housing and finally implementation. 
There are some 110 recommendations that follow this report.  
It is an excellent piece of work but I do not think it is the end. 
When I talked to the councillor in charge of social housing for Toronto he said they were just beginning.  
We have to come to grips with this. 
One government can do this. 
As we go into this corporate plan it is interesting to note what CMHC says. 
In the 1998-2002 plan CMHC says it: 
-plans to conduct a forum on ``best practices'' for addressing homelessness. 
This forum will bring together experts on the homeless, representatives of service providers and various levels of government to share information on homelessness and to recognize and promote best practices in the area. 
This will provide the basis for potential partners to work together to develop future strategies to alleviate homelessness.  
How many different ways do we have to look at the same problem? 
One would almost think the city of Toronto was doing this in isolation. 
This task force received assistance from all kinds of experts. 
Did it get it only from Toronto? 
They received assistance from Canadian cities like Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver and Winnipeg. 
They also went to American cities like Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington.  
This task force is not made up of amateurs. 
These are not people who do not care about policy. 
These are not people who are unaware of what is to be done. 
Now CMHC says it will conduct a forum. 
We have the information we need. 
It knows all about this.  
Definitions of affordable housing have been or are in the process of being written in several communities. 
In a number of cases housing strategy documents outlining definitions, policies, procedures and specific methods to address housing issues have also been produced.  
A variety of housing related techniques such as density bonusing and housing agreements is currently being utilized by municipalities to increase the diversity of the housing stock or to produce affordable housing units.  
To increase residential density, many municipalities are permitting housing above shops, manufactured home parks, secondary suites and small lots for single family housing.  
A definition of special needs housing has been developed or is nearing completion in many municipalities. 
Although the definitions vary, they speak to the importance of creating both market and non-market housing for individuals with special needs.  
Municipalities are taking up the challenge and finding innovative ways to meet the need for special needs housing. 
Committees or task forces are dealing with special needs populations or addressing disability issues at the community level in a large number of municipalities. 
Reports or surveys identifying the special needs population have been produced or are underway in several areas of the province.  
Municipalities are developing guidelines for adaptable housing and several are promoting this type of housing to provide access to suitable housing for individuals with special needs.  
The provinces are able and competent to deal with this issue and constitutionally they have been given that responsibility. 
That is their job and now we have an intrusion into much of that through the National Housing Act and the central mortgage and housing act. 
There was a time when this was significant, in 1935. 
We have gone through this and we know what it is but it has changed into something quite different.  
The involvement of multiple levels of government creates basic inefficiency. 
It creates mutual recriminations. 
If one level of government is not doing it, then the other level says it is your job, you go do it. 
As a result the very people who were intended to be helped by this act are the ones who lose. 
Most important in all this is the confusion, the chaos, the conflict, the confrontation and the contradiction that develops because of these different levels of government getting involved in each other's way. 
We do not need that. 
It could be simplified so easily. 
Then comes the worst of all, the lack of consistency in housing policy.  
I suggest there is no consistent social housing policy as far as the federal government is concerned. 
There are immediate expedient types of solutions presented. 
The time has come for us to bring rationality to bear on this situation. 
The provinces have recognized this responsibility, have contributed to meeting that responsibility and have demonstrated they can do the job. 
As a federal government we need to create an environment that makes it possible for them to carry out the job they have ably demonstrated they can do.  
I quote directly from the statement he made on August 26, 1998 in Ottawa when he found agreement with Yukon: 
Having only one level of government involved in the administration of social housing will maximize the impact of taxpayers' dollars. 
The territorial government will have the flexibility to meet the needs of its residents while adhering to national principles and an accountability framework.  
Let us do that. 
This act does not come to grips with those kinds of things. 
It simply moves along and makes what is into law. 
Some of the things that are not yet approved are already happening and we just have not had the legislative provisions to do that.  
I believe the CMHC has lost its way in another area. 
Not only has it not dealt specifically with some of the people who are in need, but listen to this strategy which comes from the corporate plan of 1998-2002. 
The strategy in one sentence is level the playing field for private-public competition. 
It goes on to say: 
This strategy involves behaviours consistent with the corporate value of entrepreneurship, as well as the creative and effective use of housing finance tools to achieve fair competition for the CMHC and the private sector, and otherwise support competition in housing markets. 
Collectively these measures will place CMHC on a more competitive footing with private competition by reducing costs through operational efficiencies, effective asset management and product improvements.  
These are the key tactics: 
In 1998, CMHC will fund additional policy reserves and commence payment to government, based on the capital and additional policy reserves that the office of the superintendent of financial institutions (OSFI) requires of private insurers.  
That is the very point I made earlier and that is what is to be done here.  
Based on current projections, total fee payments to the federal government are forecast to be $197.9 million over the 1997 to 2002 period.  
CMHC plan improvements to its mortgage insurance product line. 
In 1998, CMHC will complete implementation of a plan for restoration of rental insurance viability through changes to existing products and the introduction of new products.  
Also in 1998, CMHC will review revisions made to the First Home Loan Insurance (FHLI) program in 1997 to determine the impacts on the commercial viability of the product, and make more improvements if required.  
In this whole area we have a private company that does essentially the same thing, G.E. Capital.  
I mentioned earlier that CMHC was going to get into another aspect of mortgage backed securities.  
To improve MBS program competitiveness, and in conjunction with improved program processes, the MBS fee structure is being reviewed to make MBS more competitive under a wider variety of interest-rate and liquidity conditions. 
In 1998, CMHC will introduce a new few structure for the MBS program that is more responsive to current market conditions. 
The Corporation will pursue CMHC-led multi-lender MBS pools in 1998. 
In the latter part of the planning period, CMHC plans to develop MBS pools for non-NHA mortgages and non-mortgage loans subject to legislative changes. 
An annual payment to the government is currently being developed.  
That is exactly what this law does. 
It allows CMHC to get into another area of non-NHA mortgages, to put these into mortgage backed securities. 
It is simply getting into direct competition.  
Here we have a crown corporation with total assets of the consolidated revenue fund of the country of Canada competing with private enterprise. 
I think that is wrong in principle. 
I do not think it is fair at all.  
It goes on: 
For seniors, CMHC plans to introduce a Reverse Equity Mortgage (REM) insurance product through at least one Approved Lender by 1999. The objective is to ensure REMs are available through two or more Approved Lenders by the end of the planning period. 
The Corporation also plans to consider MBS for REMs in 1999 or thereafter if there is evidence that Approved Lenders are unable to use their own resources to issue REMs.  
What does a reverse equity mortgage mean? 
This is for seniors who own a house or who have very high equity in a house. 
They take a reverse equity mortgage, draw down more money and the interest rate goes up.  
Here it is with a reverse equity mortgage insurance program, or at least that is what it is thinking of putting together.  
He looked at me with a blank look on his face and asked me what I was talking about. 
I told him that I had just read that the corporate plans for CMHC state that it is going to introduce a new product called reverse equity mortgage insurance. 
He said that he did not know how it would work and he did not understand how it could actually work. 
He went on to tell me that it was actually a very small market to begin with.  
Maybe that market will grow. 
I am not here to debate whether one should or should not get into a reverse equity mortgage. 
That is another issue. 
However, one of the major financial institutions in Canada does not understand how this product could work. 
There is something fundamentally wrong in what is going on here.  
We need to come to grips with a much bigger issue, which is the whole housing issue and how best it should be handled.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
Over the next 20 minutes, I will address Bill C-66, which is currently before us.  
At the end of World War II, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, commonly called the CMHC, was given the mandate- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I apologize for interrupting the hon. member. 
If he wants to share his time, he must first get the unanimous consent of the House.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel:
They would often come back to settle down in a region that was not necessarily their place of origin.  
Following the signing of the peace treaty in 1945, cities such as Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa welcomed large numbers of new residents. 
With the large increase in the number of immigrants, the CMHC's mandate was broadened in 1954 to open up Canada to immigration and to make it possible for people coming from countries the world over to at least have a decent roof over their head.  
The CMHC therefore began to guarantee the loans certain financial institutions made to these new residents of towns and cities so that they could build their own home, even if they lacked the necessary capital for a down payment.  
The CMHC continued in this role over the years, with the odd legislative amendment to its status, a name change, and so forth. 
The primary role of the CHMC has been to put in place mechanisms making home ownership possible for many people and allowing them to live decently in our society.  
As the years went by, the CHMC also acquired know how, and because of its involvement in loan insurance and housing development, invested in research and development.  
Building materials unknown at the end of the last war became popular and were used almost constantly, because one of the things the CHMC did was approve new materials, supervise the quality of construction. 
It also had a program under which, when it was loaning money or guaranteeing loans, it sent out inspectors to check that housing was up to code.  
The party I represent in the House admits this. 
We are not necessarily congratulating the government, but all Canadians who, back then and even today, have made the CMHC and its mandate possible. 
It did not spring up out of thin air. 
CMHC was not created with money that came out of thin air. 
It was created with public funds, with the money of all Canadians, through their various taxes and other means.  
However, despite CMHC's good intentions, it is not entitled to hog all the control over a specific area. 
I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who is responsible for administering CMHC, that when housing is considered according to the areas of jurisdiction set out in the 1867 Constitution-unfortunately none of us here today were present at its signing-it is a provincial responsibility.  
In the past, there was an implicit acknowledgment of this by CMHC, since most of its programs were joint efforts with provincial authorities.  
The situation in Quebec is rather special, because we have the Société d'habitation du Québec, which is kind of the Quebec equivalent of CMHC. 
Judging by my experiences with several transactions, it seems to me that-at least in the eyes of the general public, or even the smaller group of those involved in real estate transactions-there is, or at least was, a certain degree of harmony between the texts and policies of the two, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Société d'habitation du Québec.  
There was a throne speech, in 1994 I think, before the time of the Minister responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Much has changed since this troublemaker has been on the scene. 
When he enters the lions' cage, they do not attack him, but devour each other instead. 
This troublemaker comes out unscathed.  
But before the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs arrived, in a speech from the throne in 1994, the federal government-which at the time, before the arrival of the troublemaker, showed some understanding, indicated a certain intent to work with the provinces on matters of varying degrees of difficulty-indicated that social housing would be returned to the provinces.  
Following the sudden urgency that brought about the creation of the CHMC, the situation calmed down somewhat, and the government considered that, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation having fulfilled its mandate, it might be time to give back to the provinces the jurisdiction that was theirs to begin with, a jurisdiction they could exercise in the normal course of events.  
This bill reflects in many of its terms what the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation did or does, but it goes further. 
We may well raise questions. 
We know that the Government of Canada, a member of the OECD, negotiates WTO, world trade organization, agreements. 
It almost got taken as well in its negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment, MAI.  
A government, like the federal government, does not like to become entrapped. 
In international negotiations, they do not like to have to say to their negotiating partners ``Sorry, this area is not completely under federal jurisdiction, we will have to ask the provinces, we need their approval. 
We cannot say yes immediately, we must consult at home''.  
This gets to be embarrassing. 
We are not at fault. 
As I said, we were not there when the Constitution of 1867 was signed, and we were not there either when the Constitution of 1982 was signed. 
Quebec was never there.  
This is happening in several areas. 
The federal government decides to go over the head of its provincial partners and to enter into high level international agreements that affect jurisdictions which come under the provinces by virtue of our Constitution of 1867.  
The spirit of Bill C-66 is a first reflection of this. 
I am convinced that the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will elaborate on this, because I know he is in full agreement with me, and so is the hon. member for Châteauguay.  
I was hoping the bill would provide that ``If the CMHC wants to finance construction and residential development projects, it should reach an agreement with the provinces, including Quebec''. 
I realize the other provinces do not have a housing corporation such as the Société d'habitation du Québec. 
This is why it created its own housing corporation. 
It could not let others look after its problems, because the cost was too high. 
No. With all the courage that such a measure implies, the Quebec government established the Office municipal d'habitation and manages what comes under its constitutional jurisdiction.  
And then, in 1999, the troublemaker, with his colleague the Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada, ups and produces a bill that appears to ignore the policies announced in the 1994 and 1996 throne speeches. 
A new policy is taking shape and, as always, this government is inconsistent.  
They all head overseas, contacts are made and the foundations for future trade relations are laid.  
There are people in my riding who excel in modular construction and are establishing contacts in China to try to sell their products, houses that are made in the lovely riding of Chambly, which I have the honour to represent here in the House. 
Business cards are exchanged and there are handshakes all round.  
This has happened in my riding. 
The excuse given was that there is some concern that the Chinese-presidents of Chinese corporations who have the buying power-will not want to return to China and that this will become a problem for Canada, and so all the good intentions shown by both groups during the trade mission to China come to nothing.  
One might say that the right hand in this government does not know what the left hand is doing. 
This is not the first such case I have seen; it happens frequently. 
It is far less alarming if it is a Quebec company that is unable to export its know how or its products to another country. 
If an Ontario company had been involved, I think the reaction on the other side of the House would have been much faster in coming. 
This being a Quebec company, however, the reaction is much slower, the urgency less. 
We have learned to live with that.  
I am certain that, given its expertise and its finished product, the business in question will eventually manage to export. 
Perhaps it will manage to export its first modular home in two years, because this government is such a piecemeal operation. 
I just want to point out that I might have been inclined to accept the bill, as it stands, to see some good in it. 
We do indeed want things to go well, but with this bill again I have unfortunately to tell you that the government is once again denying an area of Quebec jurisdiction accorded under the Constitution. 
They are meddling in an area that is not theirs. 
They circumvent the provincial government with provisions such as the one now enabling the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to undertake negotiations or discussions with municipalities, organizations, business groups or any other body. 
They are circumventing provincial authority, which despite all, has jurisdiction in this area.  
As a Bloc Quebecois member, I cannot allow that. 
I do not know whether my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is more forgiving than I am, but I find it unacceptable. 
Once again the government is treading on provincial jurisdiction. 
Why? 
To gain visibility it cannot gain through good management, by doing a good job, realizing savings, not on the backs of the poorest with money literally stolen from the unemployed, but by cutting operating costs by so many millions-or billions-of dollars through good management.  
Government spending has not significantly decreased in the past five years. 
We are not fooled. 
I find no interest at all in this bill.  
Before concluding, I want to briefly say that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation guarantees loans when borrowers do not have the 25% for their mortgage equity, which is the rule with the banking system. 
People are told they can buy a house by putting down 5% of the purchase price. 
The CMHC lends the rest of the money.  
The downpayment on a house is often less than the fee required to guarantee the buyer's loan. 
This does not make much sense. 
First, we help the buyer and then we hit him hard.  
It is not the government that loses. 
It is ordinary people, with the insurance fee they area charged. 
They are the losers, because it is this 3.5% fee that is used to pay for all that. 
I will end on that note. 
I am convinced the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will go into much more details and discuss much more detailed cases than I did.  
Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is with no small pride that I share my time with the member for Chambly. 
We both have points to bring to this issue, and I will try to make mine well.  
I dedicate my speech to our colleague, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is here in the House. 
I will be referring to a federal-provincial dispute and presenting a few points of analysis, particularly as we both hail from the same political science department, he as a professor and I as a student. 
I am sure he has wonderful memories of the time I spent in the department. 
I do not have any bad memories of the days when he was a professor of organizational theory and the public service.  
That having been said, we would have liked to support this bill. 
Why? 
Because we are all positive people. 
I think that is known. 
Examples of an opposition more responsible and constructive than the Bloc Quebecois in recent years could not be found.  
But there is a problem. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs knows very well that the throne speech is sacred, because it is a sort of blueprint of what the government intends to do during its term of office. 
As such, the throne speech contained a commitment, just as sacred, to decentralize a certain number of powers to the provinces. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs cannot fail to recall that housing is one of the sectors the government was going to give back to the provinces.  
How can it be that we end up with a bill like this one, when what is needed is recognition of the full jurisdiction of the provincial governments over housing? 
I would like someone to explain this to me in the course of this debate.  
There are two problematical clauses. 
I do not want to get into technicalities, but there is clause 58(1)-I am sure that the minister is familiar with it-which reads as follows: 
58.(1) 
The Corporation may make loans and contributions for the purpose of assisting in the payment of, or providing allowances for, expenses that, in the opinion of the Corporation, are related to housing accommodation, and may forgive amounts owing on those loans.  
My thanks to those who made themselves available to me, particularly Mr. Asselin, who was extremely kind.  
I had the feeling that it was possible the federal government might be tempted to use this clause to create a national housing allowance.  
So I asked him directly, and his reply was ``Yes, that is a possibility''. 
This is of concern to the Bloc Quebecois, and we would not view such a possibility favourably, since it would of course lead to encroachment on a provincial jurisdiction.  
Our second area of concern is that this bill opens the door to the very real possibility that, with respect to housing, the federal government could deal directly with intermediary bodies such as municipalities, co-operatives and others involved in this field.  
We do not understand how such a clause can be in a bill. 
If the government wants the Bloc Quebecois to support the bill, I would ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, in the same spirit of positive and open co-operation that has always guided us, to be this voice in cabinet. 
It reads, and I quote: 
(2) Loans or contributions may be made and amounts owing on those loans may be forgiven under this section only with the approval of the government of the province where the corresponding rental housing project is, or will be, located.  
In other words, to synthesize, as we learned in political science, we are delighted that this government wants to invest in the housing sector. 
It is well known that there is a tenuous, almost incestuous, link between the fight against poverty and housing. 
I will come back to this.  
If the government has money for housing, it must go through those whose mission this is primarily: the provinces. 
The Government of Quebec is the only government in Canada to have a housing corporation, with the expertise, know-how, tradition, planning and management required to meet the housing needs of its citizens.  
I ask the government to take note, and we will introduce amendments as we consider this bill, at committee stage or at third reading. 
It will all be considered to ensure that no direct intervention is possible in the housing sector without the provinces being involved.  
I see that Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is nodding. 
I would ask him to share this idea with his cabinet colleagues.  
The second issue of concern to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is the whole matter of the $1.9 billion. 
The federal government is negotiating with the provinces so they will be the only ones to intervene in matters of social housing. 
That is good news. 
We have long awaited that. 
However, the amounts involved are totally ridiculous. 
I want to be very clear, because there is no room for generalization.  
Canada wide federal spending on social housing is approximately $1.5 billion. 
In fiscal year 1995-96, $362 million of that amount went to Quebec. 
This means that 81.3% of federal spending on housing takes place outside Quebec. 
I appeal to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to note that 29% of Canada's poor households are in Quebec. 
Yet 18.17% of federal spending on housing is all we get.  
All governments have decried this trend. 
I could tell members about someone who has the respect of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, an intellectual in Quebec society, for that is what he is, by the name of Claude Ryan. 
Some people will immediately think of the beige paper, others of the 1980 referendum, others still of Robert Bourassa. 
All this to say that there is a strong consensus that Quebec has not received its fair share.  
Madam Speaker, is there unanimous consent for me to table figures that could be passed out to members, particularly to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is seeking leave of the House to table a document. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Réal Ménard:
Madam Speaker, I think members will be the richer for it. 
Please pass it out on that side.  
I mentioned earlier that the federal government wants to transfer $1.9 billion to the provinces under this proposal. 
Have you any idea how much is being offered to Quebec? I could not believe it when I first heard it. 
I have the breakdown here. 
The federal government will have to discuss the issue with the Quebec government and try to settle this once and for all. 
Quebec is ready to take on all of the responsibilities for social housing. 
It makes perfect sense. 
Which of the governments is best suited to adequately and efficiently meet the housing needs of the people and solve the housing problem? 
Quebec, of course, since it is the government nearest to the people.  
However, Quebec does not want to incur losses. 
What the federal government wants to do is to transfer a lump sum that will keep on shrinking. 
You have to understand that, with a housing stock for which mortgages were signed 20, 25 or 30 years ago, at the time when the money starts decreasing, more and more repair, renovation and restoration work will have to be done. 
That is why the Quebec government is asking for $440 million just for the transfer, plus 3 tax points. 
If that were on the table, the Quebec government would not hesitate to sign an agreement and to meet its responsibilities.  
I hope our voice can be heard and I hope we can count on the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who we know is not afraid to speak loudly on some issues, to defend Quebec's interests.  
In 1994, in the first budget of the current Minister of Finance, the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation was asked for a contribution over a number of years, ending in 1998-1999.  
It is a lot of money. 
Now it would appear that, over the next few years, there will be money available in the budget for housing. 
I think this cannot be avoided. 
Housing initiatives must be linked to land management, income security and the fight against poverty.  
Again, I repeat and I hope they are listening, my question is for my colleagues across the way:
Which government is better able to meet the needs of our fellow citizens in the most efficient and direct way? 
The Quebec government, of course. 
It is closer to the people. 
The main areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as health, education and income security, are central to our fellow citizens' lives.  
This is why we want money to be invested in social housing. 
If the hon. member for Chambly was to trade places with me, I am sure he would be just as passionate as I am in his defence of social housing. 
I know this is an issue of great concern to him. 
I am sure he will fondly recall going door to door in the riding of Sherbrooke, which resulted in a resounding victory for us. 
I believe we should still today celebrate our victory in the riding of Sherbrooke a few months ago.  
All this to say that the hon. member for Chambly personally went door to door in the riding of Sherbrooke. 
I had the opportunity to talk to him about this, since he knocked on every door in a low cost housing project and has fond memories of this. 
I dare not say it was a revelation to him because he was already quite aware of the problem, but he came face to face with it and was able to see with his own eyes-the member for Chambly is a hands-on kind of guy-how important low income housing, co-op housing, is in terms of social action.  
What is low income housing about? 
It is about people who form a community and know that no matter what happens to them, they never have to be alone. 
These people can count on a community room, but also on a support network and a solidarity that are always there, in good times as in bad times.  
Again, this bill is a grave source of concern, since two of its clauses would allow the federal government to get directly involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
This bill seeks to give a more commercial role to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
It sends a conflicting message.  
We would love to support this bill, because we realize something must be done in the area of social housing. 
But there has to be the assurance that this will be possible, to the extent that provincial governments, including the national government of Quebec, agree to that. 
It is our hope that this will be included in the bill.  
How? 
I ask government members to look at clause 88(2). 
I will read it again, because I think this provision should be a model, a source of inspiration. 
If this condition were met, we could support the bill.  
We are not asking for the impossible. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
If I were to summarize this bill in one word it would be destructive. 
It is destroying the hopes and dreams of Canadians who can only imagine living in decent housing and who see this bill as the final step away from any chance of their dreams being fulfilled.  
These are people from across Canada who can talk of the difference social housing has made in people's live. 
Owning their own homes was a dream many thought was unachievable. 
Unfortunately in the last few years the federal government has been doing its best to kill that dream.  
On the surface Bill C-66 appears harmless. 
To use an old saying, the devil is in the details. 
It is these details that administer the coup de grace in the Liberal government's retreat from social housing. 
They pave the way for the privatization of social housing in Canada.  
Every province except Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia has had the complete social housing portfolio dumped on them. 
It is disappointing but not surprising that my own province of Nova Scotia was the first to agree to the downloading. 
1305 
There are people in my riding who are living in homes with plastic sheeting for a roof. 
This bill eliminates these definitions from the act and puts them at the discretion of CMHC. 
These are currently minimum requirements for social housing units. 
Unfortunately the evidence points to another, nastier conclusion. 
The reason the Liberal government is getting rid of these requirements is so it will not be required to live up to them.  
The government has tried to justify getting rid of these definitions on the grounds it needs flexibility. 
Either one believes all Canadians should have a right to decent, safe, affordable accommodation or one does not. 
Under the current CMHC act, if the CMHC takes any losses when it underwrites someone's mortgage, the federal government absorbs those losses. 
What the government is proposing is that CMHC will have to absorb any losses from underwriting mortgages itself out of the mortgage insurance fund. 
Having to absorb any losses itself may force the CMHC to deny mortgage insurance to high risk applicants. 
This encourages housing development at a point in the market cycle where the market may discourage it. 
Thus it will no longer be able to play this valuable counter-recessionary role in the economy.  
Now we come to the real reason for these changes. 
In the last few months we have heard regular expression of concern from this government about the problem of homelessness. 
The recent announcement that social housing would not be transferred to the province of Ontario was portrayed as an attempt to protect social housing in that province.  
Madam Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure to speak on what I consider to be one of the most important debates in the House of Commons when it comes to the social housing needs of all Canadians.  
I wish to give accolades to my colleague from Churchill, the critic for this area. 
A Time to Act , a guide to the study she did across the country with members from social housing, NAPO and groups of that nature to discuss the social housing needs.  
It is interesting to sit here today in the House of Commons and now have this debate on a domestic level 25 years later. 
It is quite fundamental.  
In 1990 the then official opposition and chair of the Liberal Party task force on housing, the current finance minister, condemned the government of the day for doing nothing while the housing crisis continued to grow out of control: ``The government sits there and does nothing. 
Why did the Liberal Party change its mind on many other issues? 
On such a fundamental issue as this one, why did the so-called caring finance minister change his mind and literally destroy the advancement of 75,000 new social housing units in this country?  
Meanwhile, a perfectly good home was left abandoned. 
This is the history of our country. 
There is no way we can support the bill because of what it does to aboriginal people and first nations reserves. 
I will not go into the details of it as it has been explained quite well already.  
All members of the Liberal Party of Canada have to do is read a fantastic magazine out of Newfoundland called The Downhomer . 
The Downhomer will send them at a cost of $36 Canadian, no tax, a copy of a Ted Stuckless print. 
It is a picture of two Newfoundlanders in a dory with a make and break engine. 
People from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia are abandoning their homes now and moving elsewhere to other parts of the country.  
Homelessness is no surprise. 
Cities like Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax are in a crisis state. 
It only makes sense. 
Back in the sixties the current deputy minister was left of centre and has now completely abandoned all those principles. 
The government has abandoned the great principles of former Prime Minister Lester Pearson. 
It has abandoned the principles of Warren Allmand. 
A fundamental basic right of the nation and of all world citizens should be decent shelter. 
I do not understand why a rich and wealthy country can abandon that basic, simple principle. 
In the absence of social housing, or some kind of subsidized housing, no new units will be built. 
That is exactly what they have done.  
My hon. colleague is absolutely right. 
In the next election the Liberals will be paying for it.  
There are a few things in the bill that are good and I would like to talk about some of those areas. 
I would also like to discuss the changes to the structure of CMHC's board.  
For many home buyers this takes the form of mortgage insurance.  
Second, CMHC strives to encourage competitiveness in and the health of the housing market by conducting research, by improving housing, by supporting the housing market and by the dissemination of information.  
Third, CMHC has an ongoing responsibility for federal assisted housing initiatives, including support for aboriginal communities in their efforts to become self-sufficient in developing and maintaining their housing.  
CMHC would be able to introduce new mortgage products such as reverse equity mortgages. 
These mortgages enable older residents to use the equity in their homes to obtain funds to supplement their income while allowing them to continue to live there.  
These commercialization measures are a response to potential challenges under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
According to CMHC's summary of the corporate plan for 1998 to 2002, by the year 2002 the government will have starved Canada's social housing programs by $197.9 million to pay this fee.  
How can the government possibly justify taking $200 million out of CMHC that is charged with helping house Canadians while thousands of Canadians are forced to sleep in shelters each night?  
The government needs to find a way to reinvest this money into social housing programs so that no Canadian who is in need of housing suffers because of this measure. 
I would not want to speak against the Liberals, but the government has developed a reputation, deservedly so, of appointing Liberals to government boards, qualified or otherwise. 
The minister is proposing in the bill that we should reduce the number of qualified professionals on the board by three and replace them with Liberal appointees.  
Under the legislation the requirement to have a vice-president and two public servants sit on the board would be removed. 
Only the chairman and the president would remain and the Liberal patronage appointees would have a healthy majority of eight of the ten director positions.  
That may suit the finance minister just fine, but he and his government have done nothing to provide affordable housing for Canadians and to eliminate homelessness. 
It is exactly the opposite.  
He told anyone who would listen that his government would increase funding for housing co-operatives and look for new ways to use housing co-ops to provide affordable housing. 
Instead it froze and then decreased funding for co-ops. 
Now it is trying to offload housing co-ops to the provinces and cut off funding entirely.  
I guess he has missed that target.  
According to the Assembly of First Nations, almost 50,000 or 60% of the 83,000 housing units on reserves are inadequate. 
More than 10,000 of those units have deficient or non-existent water and sewer services and 16,000 units are overcrowded. 
So much for the word of the finance minister.  
With respect to this bill, there are some concrete steps the government could take to deal effectively with the problems of inadequate housing. 
As I have already mentioned, many of these proposals were outlined by Dr. Anne Golden in her report released in January. 
It recommends that the federal government provide capital assistance for the construction of new affordable housing and the rehabilitation of existing affordable housing. 
The report also recommends that the federal government should change the mortgage and valuation rules so that in addition to commercial transactions through the CMHC mortgage insurance fund the government could introduce policies that encourage not for profit rental construction. 
The Golden report suggests that CMHC get into direct mortgage lending. 
Additional mortgage funding could be piggybacked on to the mortgage backed securities that now fund social housing mortgage renewals. 
Finally, it is very difficult for the operators of rooming houses to obtain mortgage financing or insurance. 
They have recently had two opportunities, through this bill and in the budget, but they have not.  
I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of quick questions, but I will make a brief statement beforehand.  
Does he not believe that all the Liberals have really done is reformed Tory policies?  
When the member speaks he makes us feel as though the NDP is the only party that has ever said anything right in this House. 
Today there is $1.9 billion going toward social housing. 
That was done under the previous Conservative government. 
The NDP was never in power.  
Today we have 4,000 more homes, but less money. 
This followed discussions with interest groups in meetings across Canada. 
I was listening to the national news last night. 
Today a contractor who purchases land and builds a house will have to put in a sewer system and dig a well. 
Building a house today with all those incentives, $80,000 a house, there will not be much luxury. 
By the same token, using the price of $80,000 for a house, $20 million will only build 250 houses to help the natives of this country.  
I am not saying they do not have any problems, but problems can be fixed. 
People should see the number of people who live in a small house or a small room. 
They should see the condition of some of those houses. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my hon. colleague for his excellent speech on this bill.  
However, I cannot help but smile when I hear members of the New Democratic Party pick on my party. 
When they were in office, the New Democrats have put the province in a very difficult position. 
He is a great colleague and a next door neighbour to my riding.  
When we look at the bill, we realize that the corporation would rather do business abroad. 
Coincidentally, the mayor of Toronto was here yesterday for a meeting with the Prime Minister. 
There is a level of prosperity in Toronto which is seldom matched in the rest of the country. 
They are from everywhere. 
They are from every province and virtually every city in this nation and from around the globe. 
They are not overly fussy where they come from, but they all end up in my riding.  
I do not know how the principals and the staff cope. 
I do not know how the children cope. 
How can they expect to run a soccer team or conduct a science fair when all of their schoolmates are leaving for other places. 
Similarly with food banks, there is an endless lineup at food banks.  
I am extremely proud of my community because we have coped magnificently. 
The local churches have stood up to the plate. 
They provide meals on a weekly basis, whether it is a breakfast or a dinner. 
However, we are starting to have compassion fatigue. 
We cannot continue to cope with 1,100 people in my riding each and every night. 
In some respects, I would dare say that the people of Scarborough East are being unfairly asked to house the rest of the people from Canada and around the world who are homeless.  
These motel units are no way to house homeless people. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of young women from my riding of Scarborough Centre.  
The Canada Cord Ceremony was recently held for Pathfinders who achieved this award in 1998. 
With the recent celebration of International Women's Day, these young women are perfect examples of the dedication and participation that women indeed contribute constructively to our society for a better tomorrow.

MEMBER FOR EDMONTON NORTH 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This weekend will be a very special time for the member for Edmonton North as she celebrates this anniversary with family, friends, colleagues and constituents.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Family and Children Services of Leeds and Grenville located in my riding.  
This organization has recently received its accreditation from the Ontario Association of Children's Aid Society. 
Congratulations to the Family and Children Services on receiving this prestigious status and on its outstanding contributions to our community.

NATIONAL FARM SAFETY WEEK 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is National Farm Safety Week. 
Having a riding such as Waterloo-Wellington in which there are many farms and still living on my own family farm, I realize the importance of this nationwide event.  
The farm can be a very dangerous place, as members know, if precaution is not taken. 
It is very important for all Canadians, especially those living in or visiting rural areas to learn about the dangers surrounding farm equipment and farm animals. 
This week offers an excellent opportunity for Canadians to learn about and identify the possible dangers of farms. 
Events taking place across the country can provide education and awareness of farm safety procedures.  
I would also like to commend the Canada Safety Council for putting on the National Farm Safety Week. 
Its efforts in this and other fields must be appreciated and acknowledged.

Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, March 12, the foreign ministers of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic will deposit the official ratification documents to become full-fledged members of NATO.  
As a member of parliament of Hungarian heritage, I was proud to meet last week with Mr. Sandor Papp, Hungary's ambassador to Canada. 
Mr. Papp conveyed that next year Hungary celebrates its 1,000 birthday as a state.

BIOARTIFICIAL KIDNEY 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, during National Kidney Month, it is appropriate to draw attention to research on a bioartificial kidney that is cause for hope for those with kidney problems.  
Mr. Speaker, ten years ago on March 13, 1989 the hon. member for Edmonton North made political history. 
Those of us who know her best know her as more than a parliamentarian. 
We love you, Deb, and offer you our heartfelt congratulations on the 10th anniversary of your election to the Parliament of Canada.

Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
FOREIGN AID 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, today the Canadian Council for International Co-operation has called on the government to improve our foreign aid policies. 
Our international reputation as a caring country has been under attack for the past decade. 
Might I join my voice on behalf of my colleagues in congratulating the member for Edmonton North on her 10th anniversary in the House.  
Mr. Speaker, Luc Plamondon is arguably the most prolific lyricist in the French speaking world. 
Twenty years later, his prolific talent is being showcased in the hit show Notre-Dame de Paris , a modern-day adaptation of a classic of French literature.  
Luc Plamondon believes in Quebec and in its artists. 
Over and above his personal successes, he has enabled many Quebec singers and stage performers to gain recognition in France. 
He has also been a champion of copyright.  
Today, finally, he is being honoured by the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Designed and distributed at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, this guide is supposed to be a tool to demystify the impact of the millennium bug on the daily lives of Canadians.  
I commend founder and artistic director Christopher Cotton for assembling such a talented group of musicians for the society's debut.  
The goal of this new organization is to develop a multifaceted arts program in the town of Markham, York region and the entire greater Toronto area.  
1415 
To cover the costs of its relatively modest funding, the society needs financing. 
For that Canadians can thank Reform MPs from Surrey North and Crowfoot. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we need to understand what the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights recommended.  
Mr. Speaker, the justice committee and many members of parliament have found that older criminals were recruiting 10 to 12 year olds into criminal activity because they knew they could not be touched under the act.  
The idea of lowering the age to 10 was to get those young people into the system so that the rehabilitative aspects of the Young Offenders Act could be applied at a younger age.  
Why did the minister reject that advice not only from Reform MPs but from her justice committee?  
Mr. Speaker, the best rehabilitative system for young people is strong families. 
However, we are grateful that for the first time in a dozen years the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces have received an increase in their estimates. 
Can the minister tell us why he is spending $4 million on that program instead of spending $4 million on initiating a Sea King replacement program? 
Yes, they are getting on in years. 
YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member shows a fundamental misunderstanding of division of power as it relates to the criminal justice system in this country.  
The administration of the criminal justice system is left to the provinces in this country. 
In the documents she tabled, she said the principles of the current act lacked clarity, were inconsistent and contradictory.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice seems to think that only she and her government know what is good for people and she in fact says that other people just do not understand.  
Let me remind the justice minister that the member for Surrey North is a victim of youth crime. 
He paid a terrible price and he ran for parliament on those grounds.  
How can the minister possibly say that the member for Surrey North, or this caucus or anyone across the country who does not agree with her, just does not understand?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that Canadians do not understand. 
In fact, we have listened to Canadians. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I agree with the minister.  
The child welfare system is not going to salvage these kids, and the minister knows it.  
Again, the minister says that the member for Surrey North just does not understand, that we do not understand about ten and eleven year olds. 
We prevent crime in the first place. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I find the opposite to be true. 
The bulk of jobs were full time, not part time, as the member for Québec says.  
Mr. Speaker, I shall shortly have the opportunity to table a report in this House assessing the impact of our employment insurance reform.  
I recognize the hon. member for Québec's interest in this issue. 
Now, for those women who work more than 15 hours and up to somewhere around 30, there will have to be a careful review of what the impact of employment insurance reform is on them, and what steps will have to be taken in future.  
``Why pay taxes in Canada when taxes are so exorbitant?'' 
He went on say ``When the government is too greedy, people find other solutions''. 
That is his own family.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we have done.  
However, I am prepared to admit that as we move up the income scale it may take us a long time to get to Paul Desmarais.  
Too bad his good sense did not rub off on the finance minister.  
In this case, obviously, there was violence because people were not obeying the law. 
That is because this government and the Minister of Health believe that people no matter how they were infected deserve to have the care that they need. 
I have the court case right here in front of me. 
Mr. Speaker, my question for the Minister of Public Works relates to two public projects built adjacent to the Prime Minister's private cottage in Grand'Mère, Quebec. The first one, worth $72,000, was to build an RCMP compound. 
Could the minister confirm that these two contracts were awarded without tender to the firm Construction R. Cloutier, Inc. in violation of Treasury Board guidelines for construction contracts over $25,000, and if so, why?  
For security reasons, he was hired under standard government guidelines.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's conflict of interest code requires ministers to arrange their private affairs to bear the closest public scrutiny and not to accord preferential treatment to their friends.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, after 18 months and numerous media leaks, today's long awaited youth criminal justice act will disappoint Canadians. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
However, we are not suggesting that these young people should not be dealt with, should not receive help and support and that their families should not receive help and support. 
Consequently, that is why we think it is so important to work with the provinces to ensure that the child welfare system- 
Mr. Speaker, let me remind the hon. member which government it was that froze funding for the provinces in 1989-90. 
Mr. Speaker, let me remind the hon. House that it was in our budget three weeks ago that this government made a commitment to youth justice with 206 million new dollars.  
She is experiencing extreme medical, psychological and financial hardship. 
I want to make sure we support Mrs. Musselman and the family and the families of the other crew members. 
That is why we are working so hard with provincial and territorial governments.  
This government is one that vigorously defends protected industries, like magazines, but where is it when it comes to defending the interests of genuine free traders in disputes with the United States? 
Why does the government not get its priorities straight?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have our priorities straight. 
We are also engaged in ongoing work with the provinces on air quality to reduce particulate matter out of air and other contaminants. 
Homeless people want to know when the Prime Minister will act on this crisis or will he continue to ignore homeless people?  
The conclusions reveal that Canada has the lowest cost for establishing a business among all the G-7 countries.

POINTS OF ORDER 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I know some people are asking if we will have early holidays. 
I regret to inform them we will not.  
Tomorrow we will debate the third reading of Bill C-55, the foreign publication bill. 
That debate will end tomorrow.  
Monday and Tuesday of next week shall be allotted days.  
Hopefully by the end of next week we will have passed both budget implementation bills and we will progress on legislation in the constructive way the House generally does.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
When the debate was interrupted for question period the hon. member for Scarborough East had 12 minutes left.  
It may be obscure to some people that things like bundling insurance is somehow linked to homelessness. 
We increase the pool. 
In my riding we have federal co-op houses. 
There is not a person in the Chamber who would not like to live in that kind of housing. 
It is good housing and it is provided through the auspices of the Government of Canada.  
Of course it will not. 
Regrettably the debate today is simply nothing more than one more nail in the coffin of social housing and affordable housing in Canada.  
There was no offer of funding for social housing. 
There was no offer of a national action plan for social housing. 
There was no offer of new social housing units or help for people who are living on the street, and yes, dying on the street as well.  
1515 
What we heard today from the government was that it is thinking about it, it is studying it and in fact it has already done a lot. 
I want to say that I think it is an absolute disgrace. 
I think that Canadians understand intuitively that housing is a basic human need. 
When I visited the city of Toronto, I visited the emergency shelters and saw the appalling conditions that people are living in. 
When I talked to people on the street it was really very shocking to learn what people are facing in this country.  
There was even a Liberal member on the task force. 
However, there has been deafening silence on this issue.  
In fact the bill that is before us today to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act is really going further down this path of the federal government offloading and abandoning its responsibility to Canadians in this area. 
In fact what we have seen is the federal government trying to download and devolve its housing responsibility to the provinces.  
Yes, there needs to be a partnership with the provinces. 
Yes, we need to have the involvement of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. 
In fact the federation is begging the federal government to come back to the table and to get involved.  
When we add the numbers and multiply them across Canada, on a very conservative estimate we have lost 75,000 social housing units in Canada that would have been built if those programs were still in place.  
Today is a very bad day. 
Therefore, people who unfortunately are considered to be high risk by the marketplace and our financial institutions will now be in greater difficulty, even through CMHC, because they will not have the same access they had before.  
This is an important debate. 
However, I also want to say that we in the New Democratic Party are appalled and outraged that the Liberal government has gone so far from its own platform and commitments.  
That is what the finance minister, then an opposition member of parliament, said in 1990.  
We want a response from this government that will improve and make clear that there is a commitment for social housing in this country, that will use the expertise that has been developed at the grassroots level and in the not for profit housing sector and that will encourage the development of co-operative housing in Canada that has been so incredibly successful. 
Since 1993 no new co-operative housing units have been built. 
The amendments basically undermine the programs we have had in the past and further abandon the federal government's response and responsibility to providing housing for Canadians.  
1525 
I urge members of this House, particularly Liberal members, to rethink the provisions of the amendments that are before us today. 
We should support the call from the Toronto disaster relief committee for a 1% commitment for social housing in this country.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member will know the substantial investment that the Canadian government makes to our aboriginal people.  
This is where the government's participation is, in front-line health care for the mentally ill and for those in need, et cetera.  
In addition, the member also knows about the RRAP, the additional funding for rehabilitation.  
Where is the commitment to meet this very important social need?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-66, amendments dealing with the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. 
It would be impossible for any of us to fully cover them in such a short period of time.  
It is fair to say that every Canadian needs to have adequate housing. 
Many people suffer today from a lack of adequate housing. 
With the right legislation, they probably could solve the majority of housing problems in Canada.  
Housing means many different things to many different people. 
For those who can afford adequate housing, it may mean home improvements, care and pride and working to make their living space better for them. 
Many of them are having difficulties paying for their own houses as they have been idle for far too long. 
What holds people back from finding suitable housing? 
It most often comes down to one factor: affordability, money, making ends meet.  
Those are all things that this government has had a chance to do but has chosen to ignore. 
Somehow the Liberals think it is easier to ignore the plight of those who have taxes hung around their necks like a millstone than to make fundamental changes in the way government operates to ensure that taxpayers truly benefit.  
I agree and support the principle that Canadians should have access to affordable financing to acquire housing. 
Every Canadian would be better served by having government reduce the tax burden. 
Surely even members of the government would agree with that.  
Let us eliminate bracket creep that has taken billions of dollars out of the hands of Canadians. 
Leaving money in the hands of Canadians is a far better solution to major portions of the housing problem in Canada today.  
My hon. colleagues and I have raised a number of very pertinent questions. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether the member heard my earlier comments in reference to the Toronto situation when I gave some statistics. 
Very briefly the make-up of the homeless in Toronto as a result of the Anne Golden report was 28% youth who have been alienated from their families, 15% aboriginals, 10% abused women and 30% who are mentally ill. 
It provided all kinds of support services for the homeless which attracted people from across Canada. 
The member's question is very relevant, the rhetorical question about how the bill helps Nanaimo-Cowichan. 
If the provinces were trying to save some dollars they would not provide the supports at all. 
They would let them all go to Toronto.  
The problem is that communities have to start investing in their people and in their families. 
When people have these kinds of health and social problems, it is up to all of us to identify them and to provide those needs so they do not become homeless as a consequence.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Those are not the same kinds of problems. 
If we simply took one size fits all, one solution fits all, would that really help the situation? 
I suspect that one reason this has happened in society is the preponderance in government at every level to look upon itself as big brother knows best. 
This is the philosophy that exists among governments today. 
Government takes an approach to people which lumps them together in this regard. 
We can do this if we start to work at it ourselves. 
There are agencies and people who will help, but in the final analysis we are the ones who have to do the job, take care of our lives and are responsible for that.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be involved in the debate on Bill C-66 which deals with the very critical issue of housing, something that we believe has been left behind in national debates and has not had the attention it truly deserves.  
I am not blaming the private sector. 
It just does not add up. 
What we have is a ghettoization in the inner city of Winnipeg. 
It is a real hazard for the firemen who walk in and cannot see their hands in front of their faces for the smoke and who are then faced with four square foot holes cut in the floors. 
During the 1980s under Mulroney the Tory government pulled the rug out from underneath what we used to think of as the co-op housing program and other social housing initiatives. 
That is the pent up deficit. 
We got shortchanged by the 75,000 units of clean affordable housing that would have been built in our inner cities.  
I will talk more about the need in my riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
A group of neighbours formed a housing co-op to try to take care of my own street. 
This was not because we needed housing since we all owned our own homes. 
We wanted to buy up some of the slum properties on my street and either tear them down or renovate them and put them back into the hands of families that needed them. 
You are allowed to have a duplex or transition, but a duplex at best. 
That is what motivated us to start doing some research and finding out who these people were. 
I will not use the individual's name here but he is one of the wealthiest, well known businessman in the city and I have every reason to believe that when he is at a cocktail party and someone asks him what he does for a living he says he is in real estate. 
He does not say he is a slum landlord which is what he should say because we know how he makes his living.  
Frankly, as much as I appreciate the volunteerism and all the goodwill, it is dealing with five or ten units at a time in a city that needs thousands of units. 
It is interesting to hear the Reform Party member say that government has no role to play here. 
In this example one would have to be ideologically driven with blinders on to even intimate that government has no role to play in at least setting the stage to provide for clean affordable housing for people who live in this country. 
It is a basic right. 
It was the way he felt when he was lambasting the Tory government for its woeful inadequacy in addressing this problem: ``The government sits there and does nothing. 
It refuses to apply the urgent measures that are required to reverse this situation. 
They will sleep only in the inner rooms of their house like the den or the living room because of the gunfire every night. 
They are insecure about that. 
When they are on the street they are not safe so they are always spinning around looking to see if someone is going to jump them.  
It could be a 10 year old kid on pins and needles all the time. 
These women work with these street kids who have these nervous characteristics that we see so often. 
Their argument again is that housing is the second biggest problem in terms of rehabilitation of these kids.  
I have been involved in this issue for quite some time, first as a carpenter building houses. 
I know the value of the industry. 
A business plan had to be put together to prove that the revenue coming in would meet the debt service to the loan. 
That is not some kind of handout.  
That is not to say here is $2 million, build 40 units of social housing. 
The applicant group, usually an ethnic group or a group of like minded people who come together and put together a proposal to build social housing, has to sit down and crunch the numbers. 
We are very concerned that Bill C-66 will put the final nail in the coffin of any hope to have a national housing strategy. 
We are very concerned that this pushes it just that much further to privatization of social housing. 
The official opposition will oppose the bill unless we have clarification on certain elements and see certain amendments to the bill, some of which I want to speak about today.  
Effectively by disavowing the spirit and substance, if not the letter of its social housing agreements with provincial governments, the federal government was deliberately offloading its social and financial responsibilities on to the provinces and territories at a time when they could least afford it.  
Let us look at the purpose of the bill. 
The purpose of the bill is to redefine the roles and responsibilities of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, in relation to mortgage loan insurance and to export and international support.  
Let us deal with housing financing. 
The bill will enable CMHC to adjust its insurance and guarantee operations under the National Housing Act to help ensure the continuing availability of low cost financing to home buyers in all region of Canada, promote market competitiveness and efficiency, and contribute to the well-being of the housing sector.  
These amendments will give CMHC the necessary tools to compete effectively and fairly in the loan insurance marketplace. 
This is important because, as we know, since 1993 the Liberals have stopped funding new social housing projects. 
Today we are debating housing, but it is amazing that we are not talking about the homelessness crisis in this country.  
There are about 200,000 Canadians who are considered homeless. 
However, it is very difficult to deal with the concerns of this bill given our country's housing crisis and homelessness crisis which we can even see a few blocks away from Parliament Hill. 
We see it every day on our way to work and on our way home. 
Paycheques are cut in less than half in this country.  
I have copies of recent press releases from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation which I can table if members want. 
Clearly they are not doing it inside our borders. 
The CMHC is being given no direction from the minister to help his officials increase residential construction for Canadians.  
I can relate to how first time homebuyers are facing problems. 
Construction of new housing units is actually dropping under this government, while the homelessness crisis is growing.  
They certainly have done a poor job in Canada.  
The press release I am talking about is entitled ``Infrastructure Program funds Seniors' Housing Project in Brandon, Manitoba''.  
Why are infrastructure funds needed to build homes for seniors? 
I would like to emphasize what Canadians want to see with respect to Bill C-66.  
They want to see that the bill is effective and efficient and that there are real cost controls on what is being proposed.  
There is no question that all members of this House should be deeply concerned about the housing crisis in Canada.  
Recently we heard from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities about the national disaster of homelessness, not just in Toronto, but in my own community in the lower mainland of British Columbia, in the greater Vancouver area and in many other parts of Canada.  
We know as well that this Liberal government has completely abdicated any leadership in the area of national housing strategy. 
This is one of the only industrial countries in the world that has no national housing strategy.  
It used to be that Liberals believed there was a federal role for housing for seniors, for students and others. 
I would ask the member to look at our policies. 
When they do get a job they worry about paying taxes. 
In that list of Reform Party priorities there was not a word about housing or homelessness.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
I move: 
The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, an act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.  
We are offering a permanent solution.  
In all cases both parents are working, trying to struggle to make a living. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
On the long term approach of preventing these people from becoming homeless, what we need to do is address the problem at time zero. 
We can have a national head start program using existing resources based on the motion I had passed in the House last year. 
It would go a long way in preventing a lot of the social problems that are occurring.  
I implore the Minister of Human Resources Development to work with his counterparts, the Ministers of Justice and Health and their provincial counterparts, to develop an integrated approach where they can start of with the medical community at time zero, train volunteers in the middle based on the Hawaii head start program and use educational services for children starting at age four to eight.  
Essentially it strengthens the parent-child bond to ensure that children have their basic needs met in those formative years. 
If children in their first years of life have their time disrupted through child abuse, drug abuse, being subjected to alcohol while in utero, et cetera, it has a dramatic and damaging effect on the psyche of these children and therefore does not enable them to become integrated members of Canadian society.  
This has been proven time and time again. 
We have wonderful programs from the head start program in Moncton that the Minister of Industry was a leader in to programs in Michigan and Hawaii. 
If we incorporate those and use the motion that I had passed we will have a seamless program that will prevent a lot of these problems from occurring in the future.  
The Deputy Speaker:
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on February 5, I put a question to the Minister of Human Resources Development regarding the Program for Older Workers Adjustment or POWA.  
The answer the minister gave me was not satisfactory. 
I had reminded him that on the program Zone Libre , where he had appeared, he had finally admitted that the active measures he is now offering older workers who have been laid off, such as those of the BC mine, are not the answer to the special problems of this category of worker.  
I asked him: 
Are we to understand that the minister is going to quickly throw together a new and improved version of POWA, a program that he himself cut?  
The minister answered in general terms, too general, saying he was very pleased with the creation of 87,000 new jobs across Canada, half of them for young people.  
Their problem is that it is not easy for them to have access to the new jobs.  
The work place is changing quickly. 
It is undergoing a mutation and requires new knowledge and skills. 
It is not surprising that young people eventually find a place in the labour market. 
We are very happy about it, but it does not solve the problems of older workers.  
It does not extinguish the government's responsibility to help people in dire straits.  
On its own, the labour market cannot remedy inequalities and injustices. 
The minister himself admits this in his book. 
The state must correct the inequities in the labour market.  
We must see reality as it is: older workers have real problems getting back into the workforce. 
Employers hesitate to hire them because of their age. 
To get any retraining is a lengthy process. 
The doors to the workforce are not exactly wide open to them. 
The minister is closing his eyes to the reality of older workers, and taking refuge behind overall market statistics.  
The immediate need of older workers is financial assistance to help them survive, to meet their obligations, and to negotiate the long and difficult process of career training. 
These workers have paid into the employment insurance system for years without ever using it, and now they are more than deserving of our consideration and support.  
When I watched Zone libre , I was hoping the minister was finally aware of the plight of older workers. 
Was I wrong?  
Instead of shedding false tears over those who have been excluded, when will the minister take action and introduce an improved version of POWA to do something about the poverty and exclusion of older workers who have lost their jobs?  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond on behalf of the minister. 
In response to some of the things the member had to say I would like to provide some information that may help her understand what the government is attempting to achieve.  
The government is committed to helping unemployed workers, including older workers. 
We believe, however, that the best way to help unemployed workers is to help them return to the world of work. 
The program for older workers which ended last year offered only passive income support and it did little to help older workers adapt to a changing economy.  
What the government has now done is shift its support to active employment assistance to help workers reintegrate into the workforce. 
Therefore our efforts are being directed to helping those older workers who need our help.  
We have developed partnerships with the provinces through a number of labour market development agreements. 
These agreements are helping to deliver active employment measures tailored to the needs of unemployed workers. 
The government is showing its support for these workers by offering the provinces $2 billion a year in EI funds to help support these active employment measures.  
The member may also be interested to know that the majority of older workers continue to do relatively well in the labour market when compared to other age groups. 
In fact, the unemployment rate for workers over 55 has decreased from 9% in 1993 to 6.3% in 1998. 
Any unemployment is still too much, but certainly within the target group the member is interested in there has been considerable progress. 
The government has also shown its commitment to this important sector of the labour force through our commitment to the working group established by the forum of labour market ministers. 
I thank the member for her question and for her concern. 
I hope she will continue to work with us to see that the needs of older workers are addressed.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).  
(The House adjourned at 5.37 p.m.)
