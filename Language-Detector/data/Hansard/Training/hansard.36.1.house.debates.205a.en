HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Monday, April 12, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Prayers 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On Wednesday, April 7, 1999, I received written notice from the hon. member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges that he was unable to move his motion during Private Members' Business today.  
As it was not possible to change positions on the list of priorities, I ask the clerk to drop this motion to the bottom of the list.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
The House resumed from March 17 consideration of the motion that Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on February 16, 1999, be read the second time and referred to a committee.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure today that I rise to speak to Bill C-71, second reading of the Budget Implementation Act. 
These are the fundamentals of the Canadian economy.  
When the government says the fundamentals are strong Canadians should be suspicious of the government's confidence in its policies. 
It reminds me of what John Kenneth Galbraith, the expatriate Canadian economist, once said. 
He said that one should be suspicious of governments that claim the fundamentals are strong.  
I will speak specifically of some of the issues addressed in Bill C-71 relative to the CHST, the Canada health and social transfer. 
The government will increase funding, much of which will go to health care, by $11.5 billion over the next five years. 
This will mean that by the year 2005 we will have reached the same level of federal health care investment that we had in 1995. 
Although the government promotes that it is reinvesting in health care, the fact is that it will take until 2005 to reach the same level which health care investment by the federal government reached in 1995.  
The federal government increased spending on health care and increased transfers to the provinces for that but has not provided a comprehensive and coherent long term strategy for health care despite the fact that health care costs in Canada will continue to grow by about $3 billion per year due to changing demographics. 
Again this is an indication of a government that by most accounts has a budget surplus but continues to have a bit of a leadership deficit.  
Many Canadians were appalled when the government spent $3 million of Canadian taxpayers money promoting that it was reinvesting in health care. 
Many Canadians are wondering why they did not hear ads at the time when the government was taking up to $19 billion out of health care since 1993. 
The fact is there were no such ads and the government is engaging in a propaganda machine to try to gloss over the fact that the same government which slashed health care and decimated the Canadian health care system, is now putting a band-aid on the health care system and has yet to deal with the systemic issues of the Canadian health care system.  
The Budget Implementation Act addresses the issue of the reinvestment in social transfers. 
Some $3.5 billion of this money is being paid into a trust fund. 
This is more part of the government's Mother Hubbard approach to fiscal policy. 
Instead of investing the money now into Canadian health care when Canadians need it, when the lines to receive health care have never been longer, the government is putting it into a trust fund from which the provinces will draw over the next three years.  
The reason the government set up this trust fund was to skirt around the issues that the auditor general raised over the past several budgets relative to the government's taking money out of one year's budget to spend in the future.  
Canadians need economic stimulus now. Canadians need a better health care system now. 
Last year the government had a vague whiff of a surplus. 
What did it do? 
It took $2.5 billion from that surplus and spent it on a millennium scholarship fund. 
It put the money into a pot that will not be drawn from for about three years. 
Not one Canadian in the year following that budget benefited from that $2.5 billion. 
Not one Canadian will benefit for another three years, until those funds start to go out into the Canadian public. 
Even at that point about 5% of students seeking higher education will be receiving any benefit from that.  
The fact is the government continues to tinker with the Canadian economy. 
This was referred to over the weekend at the Canadian Tax Foundation conference, a non-partisan gathering of tax experts from across the country. 
At that conference Robin MacKnight, director of the Canadian Tax Foundation, said that in his view there had been too much tinkering of late and that the tinkering had introduced far too much complexity into the tax code.  
Of course the government tinkers with everything. 
The government does not have any broad based long term strategy relative to any issue, whether we look at its policies or non-policies on the environment or at the government's strategies on the economy.  
This is not the type of government that would have the courage and vision to introduce a free trade agreement. 
This is not the type of government that would recognize the importance of eliminating a manufacturers' sales tax that punished Canadian exporters, replacing it with a consumption tax. 
This is a government that ducks the hard issues. 
It continues to tinker around the margins of the real issues, as opposed to dealing with the important problems facing the Canadian economy or any of the wide range of issues.  
Bill C-71 also addresses issues of human resource management. 
It suspends the use of binding arbitration for another two years, to the year 2001.  
Recently we had an all night debate on the back to work legislation for PSAC. 
During that debate I was as disillusioned as most Canadians when I saw the government withhold information from members of the House until after the vote on closure. 
Government members as well as opposition members, including members of the Reform Party, were successfully manipulated by the government to support closure when a tentative agreement had been reached with PSAC. 
It did not tell members of the House about the agreement because it wanted to force back to work legislation, to rub the noses of PSAC employees and its members a little farther into the ground.  
This is not good human resource management. 
At a time when the Government of Canada has the responsibility to play a leadership role in human resource management we are finding that the government again is not managing the issue appropriately. 
The morale in our public service has never been lower than it is now under this government and that is because of the government's continued disrespect for the public service and its continued efforts to emasculate the public service.  
Binding arbitration is meant to be an ameliorative step to deal with problems before using the incredibly powerful tool of back to work legislation.  
The government continues to try to circumvent legitimate labour management practices. 
It will not use binding arbitration. 
In fact it will be another two years before it even addresses binding arbitration.  
He said that Canada at this moment has a tax system which provides less recognition for the children of middle and upper income taxpayers than any of the G-7 countries.  
We are not keeping up with our G-7 partners, not only in taxes, and Canadians face the highest income taxes of the G-7, but in terms of social policy. 
Canadian single income families are treated worse in this country than in any other G-7 country. 
That is clearly inappropriate.  
Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time with the hon. member for Markham.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the hon. members' time has expired. 
I was not aware that he was splitting his time.  
Mr. Scott Brison:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to split his time?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.]):
Does he feel it is irresponsible to put in place, for instance, a millennium scholarship fund when it can be afforded by the country and bring Canada into the 21st century, hopefully with the most highly educated Canadian citizens we have ever had? 
Does he feel that putting money that is available now into a trust to be spent in future years is irresponsible?  
A few years back the member's predecessors speculated on whether there would be a surplus or a shortfall in the year to come. 
When there was a shortfall of perhaps $10 billion, which was the average shortfall, some excuse would be given to explain why targets had not been met. 
We were told that it was external influences over which we had no control.  
This government is simply doing its accounting in a different way. 
It is not spending what it does not have. 
I ask him, in all sincerity, if he considers that to be irresponsible.  
Mr. Scott Brison:
Madam Speaker, I think there is some confusion on that side of the House.  
The money in the fiscal surplus belongs to Canadians, who have borne the brunt of deficit reduction. 
It was an effort that began as early as 1984. 
In fact the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition has said in the House that it was the structural changes made in the Canadian economy which allowed the current government to pay down its deficit. 
Those structural changes included free trade, the GST and the deregulation of financial services and transportation which began under the previous government. 
Canadians need tax relief now, not in the future, not 10 years down the road. 
They need it now and they need significant tax relief now. 
While Canadians are pleased that the government is in the black, they have never been in the red to a greater extent than they are right now. 
The government took $2.5 billion out of last year's budget to spend down the road. 
If a small business person were to practise that kind of accounting Revenue Canada would be breathing down their neck. 
It is not good bookkeeping and it is certainly not good economics. 
The money that is taken out of this year's surplus should benefit Canadians who need a break now and tax relief now, and who need better investment in health care now. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Madam Speaker, as industry critic for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-71, the budget implementation act, a Liberal budget that completely fails to address the root causes of Canada's low productivity.  
In a speech delivered in Toronto on February 18 the Minister of Industry cited Canada's need for more business investment, the importance of more foreign investment to develop new technology and the significance of higher innovation. 
The minister also said that Canada's productivity growth over the past 25 years was the worst in the G-7. 
I was pleased that last month the Leader of the Reform Party and the member for Medicine Hat followed my lead in question period in highlighting the industry minister's lack of confidence in the Canadian economy.  
The Minister of Industry is not alone in his assessment of Canada's weak productivity. 
At a conference last month, just a few minute's walk from Parliament Hill at the Chateau Laurier, Nesbitt Burns economist Sherry Cooper called Canada's productivity the worst in the industrial world.  
The Liberal Party's own pollster, Michael Marzolini, added that Canada has the worst rate of productivity among our G-7 competitors.  
The Liberals have attempted to portray anybody who questions Canada's weak productivity as an enemy of Canada who does not want Canada to succeed.  
Although I can understand some of the rhetoric, I challenge the Liberals. 
Is Sherry Cooper an enemy of Canada? 
Does the Liberal Party pollster not want Canada to succeed? 
Was the Minister of Industry wrong when he spoke to the Empire Club in February in Toronto about Canada's weak productivity, low foreign investment, high tax burden and declining standard of living?  
The PC party believes that the priority to improve Canada's productivity should be on tax relief and less red tape. 
Let me be clear. 
I do not criticize the government for increased funding for organizations such as the National Research Council or the Canadian Space Agency.  
The fundamental problem with the government is that it ignores the best approach to increase the business investment needed to improve productivity: low business taxes, a lower regulatory burden and less debt.  
There is an ancient Chinese proverb which says that it is not the heavily taxed realm that executes great deeds, it is the moderately taxed one. 
Canada needs to follow these wise words.  
High taxes hurt our economy and threaten future economic growth. 
Although our country is often cited by the United Nations and the Prime Minister as the best country in the world, we received a clear warning at January's world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
Meeting participants, comprised of many of the world's business leaders, said that future economic prospects did not look bright and that heavily taxed and heavily indebted countries are particularly at risk.  
Despite the rhetoric from the government, Canada qualifies as being both overtaxed and deeply indebted. 
In particular, we need to address the heavy tax burden of businesses.  
Corporations are often the target of people frustrated with the economy. 
We will no doubt hear from some, especially the NDP, the Bloc, and to some extent the Liberals, that if only big, bad corporations paid their full share average working people would be better off. 
Of course this fair share concept implies that large corporations do not pay a heavy amount of taxes. 
It also suggests that Canada can raise taxes on corporations without any negative impact on the economy and our social programs.  
In fact there are some who believe that our economy and social programs would actually improve if corporations paid more tax. 
Indeed it was the confused Minister of Industry who said last December that high taxes should increase productivity.  
Let us take a look at the facts about business taxation. 
The first myth is that corporations are getting off scot-free. 
The reality is that since the Liberals took office in 1993 corporate income tax revenue has more than doubled.  
Canada's combined federal-provincial general corporate income tax rate averages 43%, four percentage points higher than comparable rates in the United States, our number one competitor.  
Moreover, Canada's corporate taxes are 9% higher than the average G-7 country, some of the most important economic countries in the world, including the U.S., Great Britain, France, Germany and Japan. 
Over the past 30 years the total tax contributions made by Canadian corporations, including payroll, sales, property and income taxes, has jumped 144%.  
Meanwhile, according to the Conference Board of Canada, for every single dollar in extra profit made by corporations in the past 30 years a full 62 cents was clawed back in taxes.  
Corporations have not been untouched by the tax collector. 
In fact one could make a strong argument in favour of lowering the tax burden of businesses.  
Our G-7 partners, on average, have lower corporate rates than Canada.  
Meanwhile, other developing countries such as Ireland, Mexico, Hungary and Singapore are positioning themselves through low or non-existent corporate taxes as attractive locations for business investment, business investment which, according to the Minister of Industry, is needed for higher productivity.  
Companies are mobile. 
They can choose where to invest their dollars, where to create jobs and where to pay taxes which in turn fund social programs. 
Companies can also decide where to conduct research and development and where to commercialize innovation. 
In short, companies are free to choose where to contribute to a productive economy. 
They are not choosing Canada.  
Let us look at the result of Canada's high corporate tax policies. 
While we became the place to pick the pockets of business, foreign investment dried up. 
According to the United Nations' report on world investment, Canada's share of direct foreign investment fell by 50% from 1985 to 1995. 
More recent figures put the drop closer to 60% over a 15 year period. 
The government knows that our corporate tax structure is a problem. 
There are other factors to consider beside the corporate income tax rate.  
The federal Department of Industry commissioned an independent study in conjunction with the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters Canada to determine whether changes in the corporate tax structure would benefit the economy. 
The study was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Bernstein of Carleton University in Ottawa and the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
Dr. Bernstein's analysis examined five different taxes and investment elements, including corporate income and payroll tax rates, capital cost allowance of plant and equipment, research and development, and investment tax credits.  
Dr. Bernstein's report concluded that the existing corporate tax structure is an inefficient means of raising government revenue and that the reduction of corporate income taxes for manufacturers through the provision of an enhanced manufacturing and processing tax credit would provide the most significant benefits to the Canadian economy.  
The report also inferred that a corporate tax increase of $100 million, relatively small in a $150 billion budget, would kill up to 627 jobs, the equivalent of six average manufacturing plants. 
Furthermore, a $100 million reduction in R and D credits would kill up to 3,000 jobs.  
Each of these lost jobs have an impact. 
The person working at the job pays more taxes than they would if they were unemployed. 
The person is also not dependent on income security programs. 
It is a simple economic formula. 
More jobs equals less social and economic problems, equals a higher standard of living.  
The viability and profitability of private enterprises are essential to the Canadian economy. 
We cannot have a strong economy that benefits socially as a whole without a strong private sector.  
This budget does nothing to address one of the main causes of Canada's low productivity nor does it deal with the problem of government regulation. 
Credible evidence suggests that the present program has no such grounding.  
A recent report prepared by the Business Coalition of Cost Recovery, representing small, medium and large firms that employ 2.2 million Canadians and contribute $330 billion to the national economy, detailed the devastating impact of the federal cost recovery program since 1994. 
Canada's manufacturers have been subject to a massive 153% increase in regulatory fees. 
User fees through cost recovery are among the fastest growing costs of doing business in Canada- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Order, please. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-71.  
Bill C-71 is an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on February 16 and other measures announced in previous budgets.  
This bill is about spending money. 
Budgets are all about spending money and where the money will come from. 
Today we need to make it clear where the money is coming from. 
Sometimes when I hear people talk, in particular politicians, it is as if the government has a stash of money that in its wisdom it doles out.  
This money really comes from Canadians and from the work of Canadians. 
It comes from taxi drivers who spend 12 or more hours a day sitting in vehicles and driving around their cities. 
It comes from hairdressers and barbers who stand on their feet all day cutting hair. 
It comes from nurses and teachers. 
It even comes from our pages who still do pay some tax on their huge earnings from this House. 
We are talking about Canadians' money, money earned from long hours, dedication and a commitment to production by Canadians. 
We need to keep that in mind.  
This bill, as most budgets are, in particular budgets running into the billions, is very complex. 
It is difficult for Canadians to unravel the ins and outs of how their money is going to be spent. 
It is our job in this House and in a democracy to give Canadians that information so they will be able to judge whether their government is doing a good job and whether their money is being wisely spent. 
They have a right to that information and it is our responsibility, because we get paid to do so, to provide them with that information. 
They can then make the judgment as to whether they want to continue with that kind of spending.  
This bill is divided into nine parts each dealing with some different aspects of spending. 
As one might expect, members of my party, members of the opposition, members of the government and I agree with some elements of the budget and disagree with others. 
Unfortunately the process does not allow parliamentarians to be specific in their vote on what they support or on what they oppose. 
The vote is on implementation as a whole, all nine parts and their elements.  
The vote on the budget is about the whole budget. 
Even though there are things we will want to support and things we will not want support, we do not get to pick and choose. 
In my view the government plays on this dishonestly by sometimes saying ``Reform does not support the national child benefit''. 
What it is really saying is that Reform, by not voting for the budget, does not support the national child benefit which was in the budget. 
We are now unjustly accused by the government of failing to support some things because we had to vote against the budget as a whole. 
There were too many bad things in it. 
Parliamentarians now find themselves in a quandary.  
The opportunity today to speak on the specifics of implementing the budget is very welcome. 
We are able to talk about things we support, the things we think the government did right and to hold the government to account for things we think it did wrong.  
What does this budget say to the average taxpayer? 
Liberal governments are very expensive today, as they have been for the past 30 years. 
That is number one. 
The Liberals plan on spending $156.7 billion in this next fiscal year.  
From March 31, 1999 to March 31, 2000 the government will spend $156.7 billion. 
For those out in the real world who are earning money today, $21,000 from the average family of four will be taken and spent by the government. 
That is a lot of work. 
This is not only a lot of money but we have to measure it against the fact that $21,000 from the average family of four may be coming from a wage of less than twice that amount. 
I guess the government is so brilliant it can spend our money better than we can. 
We are going to examine that premise because clearly that is the premise the government operates on.  
In other words, 27% of what the government spends is deferred taxes. 
We are making up for the fact that governments did not manage their money wisely in the past. 
For every dollar of spending the government delivers only 73 cents in the form of programs. 
Even that is often wastefully managed. 
This is hardly value for money for today's taxpayer.  
Each budget we see from the government is a continued testimony to its incompetence as trustees of the taxpayers' dollars throughout most of the last 30 years. 
The enormous sum of $42.5 billion is not available to us to spend on the things we think are important today. 
Most of us would struggle to put $42.5 billion into any kind of an understandable framework. 
I would like to help us do that.  
Forty-two and a half billion dollars is about twice the amount of all income tax paid by all businesses in Canada in a year. 
The interest of $42.5 billion represents about twice the GST collected in Canada in a year. 
In other words, if we had that money, if we had not overspent and if we did not have to pay interest we could eliminate the GST, something government members said they would do. 
We could eliminate the GST completely and still have another $20 billion left over to spend on things that are important to us.  
Here is another way to look at it. 
Let us go to the farthest eastern point in Canada, Cape Spear, Newfoundland and start laying $20 bills right across Canada to the farthest western point, the Yukon-Alaska border. 
By that time we would have walked 5,514 kilometres. 
Each $20 bill is 15.3 centimetres long or about about six inches. 
The total value of those bills would be about $720 million.  
Seven hundred and twenty million dollars will pay 1.7% of the annual interest on our debt. 
In other words, if we laid $20 bills right across Canada, from its furthest point east to its furthest point west, we would have laid down enough money to pay only 1.7% of our total interest that we cough up every year on our debt. 
We would need 59 times those bills in order to pay the entire interest. 
There would be stacks 59 bills high all the way across Canada. 
That is how much our interest is.  
Now visualize this. 
We would have to have 59 $20 bills in each stack, but if the bills were around the equator, which is about 40,000 kilometres, $5.2 billion would be required, about one-eighth of the taxes required in this budget to finance our national debt for the next year, to put $20 bills around the equator. 
The stacks would be eight high around the middle of the world to pay the entire interest.  
What if we were going to the moon? 
The moon is on average 382,000 kilometres from the earth. 
That would take a lot of years to drive, but if we laid $20 bills to the moon we would need 2.5 billion bills. 
That is about $50 billion, which is about 14 months worth of the interest we pay on the national debt to continue our trip all the way to the moon. 
That $50 billion is only about one-twelfth of our national debt.  
I go through these things because it is important to remind ourselves of how our overspending and our fiscal mismanagement in the past hangs over us today. 
It limits our choices both collectively and individually.  
Jeffrey Simpson said ``Debt is the past's dead hand lying on the future''. 
It is the future of our children and grandchildren and the future of the pages here. 
We have mortgaged their future with this debt. 
He went on to say ``The future is all about flexibility, human skills, innovation, investment, adaptability, yet only a fraction of total government spending points in that direction. 
Far more is spent on yesterday's obligations than tomorrow's opportunities''.  
That is a sad, sad message with this debt, with this interest and with this Liberal budget. 
Far more is spent on yesterday's obligations than on tomorrow's opportunities. 
That is something we cannot be proud of and which we must rectify.  
I am going to make government members happy by talking for a period of time about what we like in this budget and what we support.  
We like the fact that the Liberals have been forced to put back some of the billions they slashed from their support for health care. 
Their support for health care was already pretty meagre. 
When the Liberals brought health care in, they promised to support it 50% with the provinces. 
But they did have to put some of that money back, about half of it. 
We support that.  
As far as our party position is concerned, we have consistently been committed to protecting support for health care. 
We were calling for urgent and significant cuts in government spending in 1990. 
Even at that time when overspending was rampant, there were deficits and overspending by billions and billions of dollars every year, we still spoke out strongly on the need to protect spending in the two critical areas of education and health care.  
In 1995 we did something unprecedented in the House. 
We put out an alternative budget to the government budget. 
The understanding was that the overspending every year was just about $40 billion, nearly as much as we are spending on interest today. 
In spite of that enormous overspending, we took virtually nothing from health care and education in order to balance the books.  
With the books being closer to being balanced leading up to the next election, our campaign was to restore some of the billions the Liberals had slashed from health care and education. 
Our support for these programs has been consistent in our documents. 
This is unlike the Liberals. 
I grieve to say this because government members got up in this House and with their hands over their hearts and talked about fighting to the death, going to the barricades for health care and the Canada Health Act. 
What were the Liberals doing in the back rooms? 
They were slashing $7 billion from transfers for that program. 
That is what they were doing.  
We are glad to see that the Liberals have finally come to their senses and due to pressure from Canadians are putting some of that money back. 
We will continue to support the return of funds that were taken away from health care and support health care being given a high priority.  
The Reform Party has always advocated increased government recognition of the importance of the family unit. 
We have called for several tax relief measures to ensure that families keep a larger share of their earnings to meet the needs of their children. 
We recognize the contribution that parents make to society and the future of all of us through the birth and nurturing of children.  
Canada's birth rate is dropping. 
Many of our programs are premised on workers, a strong workforce with secure jobs and secure incomes contributing to the kind of social programs, the safety net which many Canadians say, and certainly the government has said, defines Canada. 
It is one of the defining features of our country. 
But with our birth rate dropping and, contrary to popular belief, not being compensated for by immigration, we are in jeopardy. 
I have spoken often in support of the national child benefit system as a good example of the co-operation needed among federal, provincial and territorial governments to improve the quality of our social programs. 
It is a good program, but more can be done.  
There is a lot we do not like in this budget. 
I have left it to my colleagues, many of whom have already spoken and many of whom will speak, to outline some of our very serious concerns. 
I have confined my remarks to the interest, the mortgage on our children's future, on the social safety net and on our programs.  
In conclusion, I ask the government to lift the heavy hand of debt on our future and to move ahead to something better for our children and grandchildren.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, my colleague very eloquently put forward the views of my party in reference to the budget. 
I would like to ask her a question.  
Recently, that brave lady, Beverly Smith, met with the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. 
Beverly Smith is a single parent who has been fighting the unfair taxation burden on single parents. 
She came out of that meeting very disappointed with the impression that the minister really is giving lip service to the burden on single parents.  
I would like to ask my colleague what she thinks about that meeting. 
How can we help Beverly Smith bring forward her concerns?  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:
Madam Speaker, as you know, on this issue of single income families we have had a lively debate and a number of questions in this House. 
I thank my colleague for this question because we simply cannot let this issue die. 
It is far too important to our country's families.  
There have been so many quotes over the years that families are the cradle of civilization, the birthplace of our leaders of tomorrow. 
Families are so important and so critical. 
Simply, the resources have to be in the families' hands to do their job and the work we have given them to do.  
As my colleague from Calgary East has rightly pointed out, people in this country are fighting vigorously for tax fairness for single income families, whether they be one or two parent families trying to do a difficult job. 
I can pledge to Canadians and to this House that the Reform Party, and I believe many members of this House, will not rest until there is tax fairness, until tax discrimination is removed, until the stealth taxes and the creeping deindexation of our basic exemptions are fought and conquered so that families and parents have the proper resources.  
Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Jonquière. 
I am pleased to take the floor today to discuss Bill C-71, the Budget Implementation Act, 1999. This is a kind of omnibus bill in order to implement the budget. 
Among other things, it contains some items relating to tax arrangements between the federal government and the provinces, and to the Canadian Forces superannuation plan, some changes to the Financial Administration Act and an increase to the National Child Benefit, and it broadens GST credit eligibility for single individuals.  
I would like to go into more detail on the reasons the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. 
There are three key elements of particular concern to us.  
The first is that it contains the famous change to the method of calculating the Canada social transfer. 
The government is using this bill to legalize the fact that it has unilaterally decided to change the rules that determine the social transfer, going to a system that is solely demographics based, and setting a per capita amount for each of the provinces.  
The consequences of this amendment alone will be to deprive Quebec of $350 million, or 8.3% of the $11.3 billion increase contained in this budget.  
Such a decision is somewhat out of line with the very principle of the Canada social transfer, since the purpose of the CHST is to help decrease the inequalities between provinces, particularly where poverty is concerned.  
This unilateral decision indicates once again the fact that the federal system is not always a good thing for the provinces. 
It will compel them to rethink their forecasting methods. 
A province may have decided to follow one course of action expecting a certain sum from the federal government. 
This change obliges Quebec and others to completely review the allocation of the money the federal government transfers to them. 
That sort of runs contrary to the objective of the program. 
Quebeckers will have to learn from this.  
This fact is particularly true in a period of surplus. 
The federal government and the provincial governments are enjoying a surplus. 
We saw no original proposal in the budget for fighting the very negative effects of child poverty, among other things. 
The measure before us will not enable us to fight this situation either. 
Under it money will be allocated only according to the demographics of a given province and not according to its economic situation and social problems. 
This is the first reason the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against the bill, unless it is amended.  
The second reason is the increase in the child tax benefit. 
The sad part is that the money will be available, but over several years. 
The fight against poverty will not have the same effect as if there were a massive investment. 
Still, the measure is a step in the right direction.  
I think the federal government could have made more of an effort, as far as spreading out its spending is concerned. 
It could have arranged to have the moneys available more quickly, particularly since we are in a period of budget surplus. 
Instead, the funding for the child tax benefit is spread over several years.  
By contrast, the accumulation of surpluses in the employment insurance fund was not spread over several years. 
Year in year out for the past four or five years, the government has systematically taken very significant amounts from the EI surpluses. 
This is money that is not being used to fund the employment insurance fund, but any other type of federal spending, including payments on the debt. 
There is a lack of logic with this approach. 
On the one hand, the government is putting money back for the child tax benefit, while on the other hand it is generating poverty by having an inadequate employment insurance fund that does not allow the unemployed to have a decent income when they find themselves between jobs.  
The federal government should have done more in that regard. 
It should have included, in the measures to implement the budget, something to correct the unfairness in the current employment insurance program. 
But there are no such measures in this legislation.  
The non-indexing of tax tables is also a reflection of the inadequate effort made by the federal government to correct the flaws in our tax system. 
For example, between 1986 and 1996, Quebec residents have suffered a cumulative loss of income which was caused exclusively by the federal government's decision not to fully index tax tables based on the CPI increase.  
This has resulted in a shortfall of $7,047 for people who would have made good use of that money and who actually needed it. 
In that regard, the federal government did not meet the objectives that we had in mind.  
Of course, a bill such as this one to implement provisions of the budget cannot add to what was announced in the budget speech. 
Many oversights were identified. 
The federal government focussed on health issues, but strong anti-poverty action was needed as well.  
When assessing our society's achievements, we must look not only at our capacity to produce consumer goods, but also at whether the resulting wealth is being distributed fairly throughout the community, providing people with enough money.  
Last week, I attended a presentation made in my region by Vivian Labrie, who is advocating anti-poverty legislation and who made it very clear that most of what people receive they need for their survival, for vital expenses such as food and lodging. 
There are also functional expenditures, such as those for travel and moving, and some which could be described as luxuries for high income earners.  
Nowadays, we should be more aware that each additional dollar freed up for those who earn just enough to get by has a much greater impact than an equivalent reduction in the taxes of someone with an annual income of $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000. 
In conclusion, we feel that this bill to implement certain provisions of the budget is unacceptable because the change in the CHST formula hits Quebec hard. 
The bill also fails to provide for a sufficient increase in the child tax benefit-we would have liked to see a higher increase-and it does not address the problem created by the fact that the tax tables are not indexed.  
For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against the bill.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to what the member had to say. 
He mentioned the child tax benefit. 
I think his comment was that it was a step in the right direction.  
I was a great supporter of the initiative by the government, the attempt at the federal level to reach down to children all over the country to try to alleviate child poverty, which is such a serious problem.  
It is not a problem but it is a fact of life that the federal government has to deal with each province separately in these matters. 
It seems this is a serious mistake and a serious fault in logic. 
Did the province of Quebec have the same condition of taking money away from families on social assistance and applying those moneys to the families of the working poor, or did the province of Quebec proceed to allocate the child tax benefit to all poor children no matter what the source of income of their families?  
Mr. Paul Crête:
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention.  
I will remind him why the Bloc Quebecois finds the measure unsatisfactory. 
In 1997, we called for this fund to contain $2 billion, and with the present government measures, that $2 billion will be reached, but in the year 2000.  
The impact needed to be far greater than that. 
According to the Canadian Council on Social Development: 
In other words, compared with nine similar countries, Canada ranks second highest in child poverty according to market income, and third for total income, after the United States and Australia. 
We have some catching up to do, and in our opinion we should have caught up faster.  
The second part of my colleague's question addressed how the Government of Quebec had handled this.  
Negotiations were held between the provinces and the federal government. 
The agreement was that the additional amounts put in by the federal government could be used by the provinces for other expenses. 
That led, among other things, to the $5 daycare policy, which gave 70% of parents with young children the opportunity to significantly reduce the money paid to daycare centres. 
I think that was a worthwhile measure.  
However, in connection with the child tax benefit, I think people everywhere in Canada would agree child poverty should be attacked directly and more aggressively. 
It is in this sense that the Bloc Quebecois hoped that the money allocated would be available more quickly and that the fact there is a surplus this year would mean it would be allocated quickly.  
As we can afford this measure as a society, we could act now. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget, and to say from the outset that I will vote against this legislation.  
My speech will deal with four specific points, which I will develop.  
This sixth Martin budget, the first so-called deficit free Liberal budget, is a crying shame.  
First, it formalizes the misappropriation of funds by the federal government, at the expense of thousands of Canadian workers who cannot get employment insurance benefits.  
Second, this budget does not reflect any will to help older workers who lose their jobs following plant closures.  
Third, as regards the environment, where are the necessary moneys to fulfil the commitments made in Kyoto?  
Fourth, this budget gives legal status to the federal government's will to encroach freely on provincial jurisdictions, by getting fully involved in areas of jurisdiction in which it has simply no business.  
However, no matter how shocking and outrageous the Liberal government's attitude may be, it does not surprise anyone. 
About this time last year, when it tabled its previous budget, this government showed its true colours.  
Members opposite are getting all worked up. 
If the government really wants to help young people, why does it not transfer the moneys to the provinces, which are responsible for the loans and scholarships programs?  
Quebec has the best loans and scholarships system. 
Our program adequately meets the needs of young people. 
Why not recognize excellence and give to the Quebec government additional funding to ensure a sound management of that initiative, instead of duplicating an efficient system?  
That was a year ago. 
Now, the Minister of Finance, our master magician, our sleight of hand specialist, is getting into the act and unveiling his own monument. 
He did not want to be outdone. 
For weeks, he laid the groundwork. 
Now we are considering the budget and what do we see? 
We see a Minister of Finance completely lacking in long term vision, a Minister of Finance whose concerns are all short term and motivated by political gain. 
What a bitter disappointment this is for all these workers and middle income earners.  
In his new budget, the Minister of Finance is determined to conceal his surpluses rather than turn them over to unemployed workers and middle income earners.  
Having contributed to the acknowledged $4.5 billion surplus in the EI fund, six out of ten Quebeckers and Canadians who lose their jobs will still not qualify for benefits. 
Many of my colleagues have spoken at length in the House about the unfortunate and very harmful impact of EI reform on women, pregnant women and young people. 
What the minister is doing is no small matter. 
Workers and employers contribute to this fund. 
The federal government has not put in one red cent in over ten years.  
In this budget, where are the proactive measures, particularly those for older workers over the age of 50? 
Thousands of people in the various regions of the country will be affected by plant closures or massive layoffs. 
Where are the concrete measures in this budget to help them?  
This government has abolished the program especially designed for them, POWA. 
Did these workers not contribute to the employment insurance fund for years? 
Many of them have never drawn benefits. 
This is an essential measure for them. 
The billions of surplus dollars that have accumulated must be used for this purpose, among other things.  
Why has this minister not been listening to the thousands of workers by introducing such an active and positive measure in this budget? 
Perhaps the answer is obvious.  
Where are the concrete messages to the middle-class taxpayer? 
Are these not the people who have made it possible for the Minister of Finance to do away with his deficit? 
Why has he not used part of his hidden surpluses to adjust the tax tables to the cost of living, thus putting $2 billion back into the economy?  
Such a couple pays $4,000 more taxes yearly than a couple with both spouses working. 
As my party's critic on the environment, I was greatly disappointed that the budget did not show any willingness, on the part of the government, to act in this area. 
Yet there is extreme urgency. 
This government is already behind on the formal commitments it made at Kyoto on eliminating greenhouse gases. 
And what about the elimination of 5,000 contaminated sites? 
Where is the money to get started on decontamination?  
What about highway rehabilitation? 
Where is the funding for this? 
When is there going to be any follow-up on the $16 billion proposal made last spring by all provincial ministers of transport to the Government of Canada, with the agreement of their ministers of finance?  
Once again, I see that this is just a lot of fancy talk by the Liberals, with no willingness to do anything.  
A few days ago, on March 29, the Minister of Transport told us he was trying to convince his cabinet colleagues to give him $3.5 billion for this, whereas the provincial ministers of transport are talking about $16 billion. 
It is always tomorrow, tomorrow, later, later. 
We see no willingness to act in this budget.  
Where is the money for this year? 
When are they going to bring back programs such as the strategic highway improvement program, which all the provincial ministers of transports are calling for?  
Quebeckers, particularly the people of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, are not fooled by the fancy words repeated by petty politicians. 
The Conservatives did the same when they were in government between 1984 and 1992. 
They did nothing to improve roads, especially highway 175.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois are here to tell them the real truth, to defend them against these petty politicians, because Ottawa is not so far removed and we are well informed.  
Another matter dear to my heart is regional development. 
From every podium, we hear this government saying that its first priority is regional development. 
Is there a bit of ``Do as I say not as I do'' here? 
I think this can be said of the Liberals. 
If there is one thing I am sure of, it is that in this budget, in black and white, spending on regional development was cut by $100 million cut this year and $200 million next year. 
Find the discrepancies between the words and the figures.  
Our national Minister of Finance also treated himself to a monument in this budget, the find of the century, the health care budget.  
Canadians are not fooled. 
They know very well that the Liberal government is responsible for the deterioration in this country's health care system. 
They know the real story, not what the government would have them believe.  
Since 1994, the government has slashed provincial transfer payments for health, education and social assistance by over $6.5 billion. 
The Liberal government is to blame for the terrible repercussions on the entire health system from coast to coast.  
Underlying the Minister of Finance's new health budget is a dark history of billions of dollars in cuts that have hit the public very hard, and we must never forget it.  
With the support of his colleague, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Finance is now charging into the health sector, a provincial jurisdiction, and imposing his views, new structures, statistics, monitoring, and additional paperwork. 
The final cost will be $1.4 billion over three years. 
This money will not benefit the sick; no, this government prefers to spend $400 million on administration alone just for the visibility.  
What is the word for this? 
Irresponsible. 
But I say to the Minister of Finance that it is not too late. 
The minister should show some compassion and hand over these millions of dollars to the provinces with no strings attached so that the public can finally get the care to which it is entitled.  
In conclusion, for all these reasons, and for all the other reasons my Bloc Quebecois colleagues have mentioned in their speeches, I will be voting against Bill C-71.  
Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Jonquière for her good speech. 
I want to ask her a question concerning a very important point she raised, namely the issue of older workers.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development keeps telling us that active measures are in place for these people. 
Could the member for Jonquière elaborate on the fact that, in the case of older workers-those aged 55 and over-active measures are often not enough, and passive measures are also necessary? 
The word ``passive'' may sound derogatory, but we are referring to support measures to help these workers make it to retirement. 
Would it not have been appropriate to include such initiatives in the budget?  
Furthermore, is the hon. member pleased that the proposal made by the Bloc Quebecois, for which she is the critic, resulted in this issue being submitted to the human resources development committee, which will look at it over the next two months and which will hear witnesses? 
Would the hon. member like to send an invitation to those who made representations to us and who would like to take part in the committee's work regarding this issue?  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my Bloc Quebecois colleague.  
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques is a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
In the riding of Jonquière, between 200 and 300 workers will lose their jobs in the weeks to come. 
It is all fine and well to tell a worker between 50 and 55 years of age that he or she will get training, that he or she will be sent back to school, but these people need other things.  
We will be very pleased to hear all their suggestions.  
It is not true that this issue is really a priority for the government. 
The government is not providing proactive measures for this group of citizens. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House for what might be one of my last times to talk about the budget.  
The budget sets out a road map for the government. 
If we look at that issue we see a government which has over the last five years cut over $21 billion out of health care and is about to put $2 billion back. 
This is not the kind of health care commitment that would qualify most budgets in the minds of most people as a health care budget.  
The budget did many things and omitted many things. 
Canadians face a health care crisis which the budget addresses in a small way.  
The population at large faces significant challenges with regard to job opportunities for both parents and younger people. 
The country also faces challenges with regard to the accessibility of students to education and a whole range of other questions including homelessness, our infrastructure problems and a tax system which remains extremely unfair.  
The budget did nothing to improve the benefits for those most vulnerable in society, the unemployed, a group for which the federal government has responsibility in terms of its legislative jurisdictional powers over employment insurance and as a result of its control over fiscal and monetary tools which leads to certain levels of unemployment in the economy.  
Over the last 10 or 11 years I have been in the House unemployment has been used as an economic tool for various other purposes dealing with interest rates, the value of the dollar and so on.  
Nothing was done in the budget to combat the homelessness crisis with which we are all familiar. 
The Prime Minister has taken some steps since, but there is nothing in the budget or in the finance minister's set of priorities to ensure that those who are facing life's most severe problems, the unemployed and the homeless, have those matters addressed by the government. 
That is a priority which is askew.  
There is nothing to address the unfair tax system. 
This hardly addresses the problem. 
It seems to make the problem worse.  
There are other things too. 
There is nothing in the budget to tackle what are environmental concerns across the country, even the simple issue like a transit pass being available to employees in the same way as parking passes are. 
This modest and easy to administer environmental change did not find its way into the budget. 
As we probably all know, there is no adequate or proper funding for our cultural institutions.  
Major Canadian priorities are not being addressed in the budget even though some tax changes were made. 
A person who makes $10,000 a year in income will receive from the budget tax savings of $51, a dollar a week. 
The more we make the better off we will be. 
That is not the priority of those who are fighting to survive in what is an ever increasingly challenging world. 
If one is making $1 million a year one will get a $8,000 tax break from the budget.  
Let us remember all the fuss about whether or not hockey players should get tax breaks to stay in Canada. 
They did because those millionaire hockey players will get $8,000 extra a year to play in Canada while a family trying to get by on $10,000 will make $51 a year more, probably not enough to buy one ticket to go to a hockey game to watch that millionaire hockey player who gets an $8,000 tax break play in Canada.  
Even where changes are made we see them made in the interest of those who are better off rather than in the interest of those who are less well off. 
The government made much of the budget being a health care budget. 
Over the years of the Liberal government and over the years of the hon. member for LaSalle-Émard as the Minister of Finance, we have seen $21.5 billion taken out of the health care system. 
Only a couple of provinces have been able to fill that gap.  
In my province of Saskatchewan each year the NDP government has consistently put more money into health care than what the Liberals took out, at a great burden to a province with a small tax base and significant financial problems left over from nine years of provincial Conservative government mismanagement. 
What is the response of the Liberal government? 
As a result of the budget it will put back $2 billion, one dollar for every ten that was taken out of health care. 
We know the angst across the country over the state of our health care system. 
That angst is exacerbated when billions of dollars are cut from the health care system.  
This is a modest prescription for the health care crisis caused by the federal government over its years of belt tightening. 
This modest prescription will not satisfy the needs of Canadians or do anything very significant to improve our health care system.  
I would add in terms of the priorities of the most recent budgets of the Liberal government that it is plain the brunt of deficit reduction was borne by the most vulnerable in society. 
However, the way in which he did it meant that he attacked the most vulnerable in society. 
That is in sharp contrast with the way in which Saskatchewan balanced its budget, the first province to do so. 
There were increased commitments to the things that are most important to Canadians, not the Liberal model of increased cuts to the things that are most important to Canadians.  
In that strategy, in that model of Saskatchewan NDP government's deficit reduction, we saw continued increases in funding for health care, education and social programs, not cuts. 
That is a distinct contrast with the way in which the deficits were addressed in the two jurisdictions.  
We remain with some serious problems that could have been addressed by the government but were not. 
For example, as students have indicated the budget does nothing to solve student debt and the base funding crisis facing post-secondary education. 
Tuition fees will continue to rise while the quality of education continues to erode according to the students. 
Those of us who spend any time on university campuses can ensure that is the case. 
Without increasing accessibility, without increasing the numbers of Canadians who have access to post-secondary education, it is difficult to see how we can solve the economic difficulties we face.  
On a personal note, as someone who is the only person from my extended family to attend university, and it was 30 years ago at least when I was at university, the question of accessibility is a critical one that we cannot leave in the state in which it is at present. 
It takes a lot of support for those who come from families who do not traditionally see university education or post-secondary education as a tool for their children to find a way to break through and to have access to post-secondary education.  
It is an obligation of the country as a whole and of the government which represents the country to ensure that accessibility is there. 
It is the only way we will individually ensure that we can make the greatest contribution to our economy and to our society. 
Education is critical in this regard and yet nothing in the budget addresses this matter.  
Children in poverty is surely the most serious problem we face. 
Not only Catholic bishops but practically everybody in the country has called this issue a national disgrace. 
There is nothing in the budget for Canada's poorest children, even though there is much rhetoric on this point in a number of committee reports and so on from the Liberal caucus.  
There is nothing for homelessness, nothing for those who do not even have a place to live in what is one of the richest countries in the world. 
As the Minister of Finance indicated in the past, only the national government has the financial resources to address the full dimensions of this problem.  
There is nothing for child care. 
Again this is holding people back rather than enabling them to move forward.  
I mentioned the problems of our tax system and how unfair it is. 
The Minister of Finance could have taken a lesson from the Saskatchewan NDP government's book and in fact given everybody a break, particularly those on low income who spend all their money on the most basic items. 
There is no commitment to assisting those at the lowest end of the economic scale with a tax break.  
Perhaps the most glaring omission is with regard to those who are unable to find work in Canada and are forced to rely on what is becoming an ever more meagre unemployment insurance system. 
There is nothing to address this concern. 
Indeed everyone has to be reminded that it is the employment insurance surplus which has made the deficit reduction record of the government as credible as it is. 
In other words the taking of money from those who are working and those who are unemployed in order to balance the country's books. 
This is not something many people would be proud of.  
We face significant problems across the country both in highways and in other infrastructure elements. 
There is nothing in the budget for them.  
While budgets set out a course of action and a set of priorities which should represent the priorities of Canadians, it is clear that the budget has not done that. 
More important, it has left the most vulnerable, the most in need, out of the picture almost entirely. 
That is to be regretted.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC)]:
Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to state to my hon. colleague, the member from the province of Saskatchewan, since he mentioned that this may be one of the last speeches he makes in the House, that I consider him to be a very thoughtful contributor to the House of Commons. 
We wish him the best in his future endeavours as he moves into another venue.  
Although his approach in terms of social democracy may be different from my fiscal conservative approach, he did highlight some priorities in terms of what the economy has to do. 
The best way to actually grow an economy in which we can make interventions with respect to education and our health care system is to lower taxes and lower our debt level. 
Then we could have a more vibrant private sector that would increase revenues. 
We have seen this in the province of Ontario where the Harris government has been able to lower taxes and therefore increase government revenues.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's earlier comments. 
Of course I regard him as a friend as well.  
The point the member makes is an interesting one. 
If it were the case that tax cuts were the answer to problems faced by countries at the turn of the century, we would see countries with very high tax burdens being totally unsuccessful in the economic ventures we see ourselves facing. 
Countries with high taxes like Germany have very successful economies. 
There is no panacea to tax cuts as an instrument of ensuring economic success.  
I would not necessarily put the member who spoke in this category, but the unfortunate aspect of those who argue for tax cuts is that it is a smoke screen for eliminating social services, social programs and government initiatives that those people find undesirable but the population at large finds quite desirable, continues to vote for and continues to see as important.  
Health care is perhaps the greatest example of this. 
It seems that people will always take health care over tax cuts. 
There is no clamour across the country for the kind of tax cuts which the Reform Party and to some extent the Conservative Party argue for. 
I recognize that we cannot have a tax system that is far out of whack with our competitors' tax systems if we expect to be able to compete with them in terms of ensuring that our young people stay in this country to work, in terms of ensuring that employers invest in Canada and in terms of ensuring that we are competitive.  
Canadians deserve tax cuts. 
We need a more fair tax system which also reflects our international competitive situation.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about tax cuts. 
The member for Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar is a little off track when he talks about who should get tax cuts. 
It is middle income working Canadians who have continuously borne the brunt of the tax burden. 
They pay far higher personal income taxes than those in any of the G-7 countries. 
We pay the highest.  
Although there is ample evidence, the member does not recognize that there is a direct correlation between a buoyant economy and a liveable tax regime. 
We do not have that in this country. 
The governments of Alberta and Ontario have taken some bold steps to lower the personal income tax levels of provincial workers. 
Those are the two leading economies in the entire country. 
Despite the tax cuts, their overall revenues have dramatically increased because their economies were given that stimulant.  
That is what will get the economy going again and that is what will provide money for social programs.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy:
Madam Speaker, the member will know that the primary beneficiaries of the tax cuts he mentioned in Ontario and Alberta are the wealthy, not middle income Canadians. 
I share his view that it is the middle income Canadians who face the brunt of our tax system. 
They are not getting good value for their money. 
However, it is still the case across the country, no matter what the Reform Party says, that Canadians recognize the importance of the kinds of services that define the country-health care, education and social programs-and the need for those services to be paid for by tax revenues. 
That support, no matter what the Reform Party says, is there. 
It is there solidly and it will not go away.  
Hon. Don Boudria:
Madam Speaker, I wish to seek consent for the following motion: 
That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice, during consideration of Government Order, Government Business number 23, any speech by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition may be followed by a ten minute period for questions and comments and the House shall continue to sit after 6.30 p.m. this day for the purpose of considering the said Government Order, provided that after 6.30 p.m. the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls, dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent to propose any motion and provided that when no member rises the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to proceed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I appreciate the hon. House leader's point; however, we in the Reform Party would wish to be consulted just a bit more on this motion before we give concurrence.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not consent at this time, so the House will resume debate.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the budget implementation act.  
I will start by quoting from today's morning smile in The Globe and Mail . 
There is a sign at the dry cleaner's which reads ``We charge GST, PST, EHT, UIC, WCB and a small fee for cleaning''. 
A small fee for cleaning. 
That is the livelihood of that small businessman. 
That sign talks about the economic conditions in this country.  
We are in the middle of the tax season, the time when Canadians realize how much they pay to the government. 
It is not a pretty picture.  
Canadians have been complaining for years, but the government has not listened to them. 
Now we have economists and tax specialists joining the debate and calling for a reduction of the huge tax burden. 
There is a fine article today in The Globe and Mail which makes reference to this.  
We have to know what is this burden. 
The burden consists of federal income tax, payroll taxes, provincial taxes, municipal taxes, GST, PST, and the recent phenomenon of user fees, which I call hidden taxes.  
Let me dwell on some real examples of what hard working Canadians are facing. 
He asked me a very simple question. 
How can the government justify taking taxes from a low income family? 
I asked the same question. 
How does the government expect a family of four to survive when such a large portion of their disposable income is taken away? 
It is no wonder we are hearing of rising child hunger and poverty among our fellow citizens.  
I would like also to turn my attention to the plight of small businesses in our country. 
During the last month I have heard from the owners of three small businesses who have approached me about recent rulings by Revenue Canada. 
These small business owners put in long hours and try hard to put food on the table for their families. 
Let me say at the outset that they are also willing to pay their fair share of taxes and have been doing so for years. 
What is happening to them now? 
These individuals run small trucking and cleaning firms. 
They work hard to get contracts and to sell their services to prospective clients. 
They also hire people to provide services on a subcontractual basis. 
It is a fine arrangement that helps both parties to put food on the table. 
It is not easy for them. 
They work long, hard hours. 
They make a small income, enough to provide the basics for their families.  
Lo and behold, Revenue Canada enters the picture and says that this arrangement is not right. 
They say ``Sorry, but you have to pay EI. 
We do not accept these people as being subcontractors''. 
To make matters, worse it is backdated. 
Suddenly a successful business is facing a crisis. 
It is threatened with bankruptcy, which will put people out of work and send them back to welfare.  
They have said that this arrangement is the most economical and viable option they have to keep them employed and to put food on the table. 
They have been forced into this kind of arrangement because of high payroll taxes and taxes that keep going higher and higher.  
Instead of helping these people, instead of letting them use their entrepreneurial skills to earn income for their families, the government is forcing them into the hands of creditors.  
It is ridiculous to tax people so much that they are forced to go to food banks and welfare. 
In the end it costs us more. 
To make matters worse, how do these people feel when they see that while the government is reducing their meagre incomes through taxes it is spending their tax dollars on projects like a tunnel for senators so they are able to go to their offices in comfort and avoid a two minute bus ride? 
What about the millennium project; spending $140 million on what basically is a party?  
Something needs to be done. 
The time has come for a real tax break, not just cosmetic changes. 
For years Canadians have been held accountable to pay taxes and they have complied. 
Now it is the government's turn to show accountability in the way it uses that hard earned tax money. 
Unfortunately this year's budget contains precious little for Canadians to smile about.  
Let me quote what some economists and tax experts are saying. 
``Our taxes are snuffing out innovation, investment and entrepreneurial spirit''. 
That is from Sherry Cooper, senior VP and chief economist of Nesbitt Burns. 
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said ``The government has chosen to spend far beyond what it had budgeted for just one year ago. 
Spending for 1998-99 will come in at a stunning $7.6 billion higher. 
In 1999-2000 program spending has been set at $111.2 billion, a $4.2 billion increase over the $107 billion projection in last year's budget''.  
It seems to me that we cannot get the Liberal government off our backs.  
This year's federal budget does not address many issues. 
My colleague from Calgary-Nose Hill this morning said what she liked about the federal budget. 
I would like to dwell on the issues we do not think the government has addressed.  
It was the usual pay more and receive less budget. 
I do not understand why the government cannot get off our backs and allow Canadians to bring prosperity to the country.  
There are examples. 
There is the Ontario government. 
The Alberta government has decided to uncouple its taxation system that is tied to the federal government. 
It is the first provincial government to do that. 
That trend will carry on because they do not see the federal government addressing what Canadians are looking for.  
Personal income tax continues to make up the largest share of household spending. 
In 1997 an average of 21 cents of every dollar of household spending went toward personal income tax, as opposed to 20 cents for shelter, 12 cents for transportation and 11 cents for food. 
These figures are from Statistics Canada.  
No wonder many of our brightest and best are moving south of the border.  
After tax family incomes declined by over 5% in real terms from 1989 to 1996. 
Personal savings per taxpayer have fallen to an all-time low. 
Canadian families continue to work harder and harder and find they have less at the end of the month.  
The government continues to ignore the critical issue of lowering the debt rapidly. 
The costs of social programs will rise dramatically early in the 21st century. 
We will not have the financial means to handle the increase because of the massive debt hanging over us.  
Where has this budget failed on social programs? 
People work harder and pay more income tax. 
Canadians have heard about tax relief from this minister in past budgets but have seen little happen. 
Most will find that the basic personal amount remains at $6,456, a pitifully low amount as a basic deduction. 
Because the basic deduction is not indexed, its value decreases each year by the rate of inflation. 
What have we gained? 
The government talks about tax relief but grabs it back through deindexing or stealth taxes.  
The government has promised that over 200,000 low income Canadians will be removed from the tax rolls this year. 
Can we trust that promise? 
As it stands right now, unemployment insurance premiums are too high and with benefits declining, this gives a surplus which basically belongs to Canadian workers and business people. 
To make matters worse, the finance minister wanted to use this fund to balance the budget.  
The government's budget has been totally silent on homelessness. 
It is a growing problem which the federal government should look at and decide what measures it should take.  
What do we have in this budget that is going to take us into the next century? 
Unfortunately Canadians have nothing to smile about.  
The productivity gap is growing. 
The government's own minister talked about it. 
As a matter of fact the ministers are fighting over the issue. 
The standard of living for Canadians is lagging further and further behind the U.S. and other countries. 
The brain drain continues with an increase in loss of international competitiveness. 
The government has reduced opportunities for many.  
I have indicated in my examples what Canadians are facing and what this government has failed to address. 
I hope the government will listen to what Canadians and economists are saying.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with some interest to what the member had to say.  
One of the major budgetary items of the government in recent years has been the child tax benefit. 
This is an allocation of upwards of $2 billion to the children of the poorest families in Canada. 
In my riding poor families looked forward to this with great anticipation. 
Here at last was a substantial allocation per child to the income of the poorest families in the land.  
The federal government has to make particular arrangements with each province when it is flowing money of this type. 
Even though I suspect the vast majority of people in Canada support the idea of combating child poverty, the arrangements were different in every province.  
In my own riding there was great disappointment when it was discovered that because of the arrangement we had to make with the Government of Ontario, the province took away from those low income families which were on social assistance the amount the federal government had added to their incomes. 
As a result there was no change in their income.  
It is true that because of the agreement the federal government made, the moneys the provincial government took away were flowed to programs for low income working families. 
Nevertheless, there was no change in the income of the impoverished families and children. 
In Ontario more than 40% of the people on social assistance are children.  
The member represents a riding in Alberta. 
Would he explain to the House what the Government of Alberta's policy was and what his position was with respect to the flowing of the money to low income children through the child tax benefit which this government introduced?  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
Madam Speaker, I am very happy to answer the hon. member's question.  
I will dwell on the first point, the child tax benefit. 
It is amazing that he says the federal government is giving child tax benefits. 
I tell him it is not in this budget. 
The government's child tax relief is going to come in 2000 and 2001. 
Why not now? 
The member talked about his constituency and what it was looking for. 
The member in his second question talked about Alberta. 
I mentioned in my speech that the new tax the Alberta government came up with is uncoupled from the federal government. 
Why did it decide to uncouple in the year 2000? 
Alberta has decided to uncouple from the Liberal government so it can give tax relief to its citizens. 
That was one of the best things the Government of Alberta did. 
It has come up with one of the most innovative ideas in this country, a single flat tax rate. 
This government could learn from Alberta.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, to echo the words of my colleague from Calgary, the Liberal government since 1993 has stood in the House and told us how important the child care tax credit is to it and how it places this as a high priority. 
The government says it is a high priority yet it fails to act.  
I wanted to make that comment so that the member opposite is clear on what his finance minister has done. 
Perhaps he did not know that it was not in the budget. 
It is very important and the finance minister, despite his balanced budget and the so-called surplus, has failed to address it.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for bringing that point up.  
Again I would like to take this opportunity to advise my colleagues on the other side of the House to look at what the Government of Alberta has come up with, to listen to the voices of Canadians and get off our backs with high taxes. 
I have given members examples in my speech. 
They should look at those examples. 
They are real Canadians who are suffering. 
The government is sending them into bankruptcy. 
They must be allowed to work and put food on the table. 
The government must get off the backs of Canadians.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member opposite was commenting on the child tax credit, which is a positive initiative and heads in the right direction.  
However, if he really wanted to ensure that we actually have fairer taxes, he should read the initiative that we proposed in Winnipeg in 1996 as part of our policy document. 
The Reform Party dedicated an opposition day in the House with respect to ensuring that we have fairer tax treatment for families with one parent who chooses to work in the home and one parent who actually- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the member. 
The intent of my recognizing you was to ask a question to the member for Calgary East.  
Mr. John Herron:
In lieu of the comments I just made, would the hon. Reform Party member concur that if we want to ensure that all children are treated equally we should tax families that have one parent working inside the home and one parent working outside the home in the same way as we do dual income parents?  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his very important question. 
I agree with him. 
Only four days ago there was a headline in the Calgary Herald that 6,000 children in Calgary face hunger.  
When Beverly Smith met the minister, the impression she got was that the government was not interested in stay at home parents.  
I concur with the hon. member that this is an absolutely important issue. 
I thank him for bringing it up. 
We know that the government has yet to do something about that.  
Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, this is an important moment in parliament when we debate the budget, and we cannot debate the budget without discussing the government.  
When the Prime Minister shuffled the cards and selected cabinet, he said ``I need a cabinet with a lot of jacks, not too many queens and definitely a lot of jokers''. 
This is essentially the distribution that has inspired the government in implementing its policies.  
This budget is disappointing, for two reasons. 
First, the government failed to deal with the right priorities. 
What would they have been? 
The fight against poverty, naturally. 
There have never been so many poor in Canada. 
A look at the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s or the 1990s reveals that there are more poor people now than ever before. 
What is the government doing about this problem? 
Nothing.  
The people in the Bloc Quebecois are very committed to the fight against poverty. 
There is myself, naturally, but there is also the member for Québec and my colleague from Rivière-du-Loup, who has led and continues to lead a fight for an independent employment insurance fund. 
The other disappointment we had with this budget is that it confirmed and perpetuated the hallmark of Canadian federalism-government intervention in provincial jurisdictions.  
Historians will understand, on analyzing the years 1994 to 2002, that this government was one of those that had the least respect for provincial jurisdictions. 
It was one of the most interfering governments.  
I see the Liberals smiling. 
As they say, the fool laughs and the sage smiles. 
There is no lack of smiles on the other side of the House. 
This is a bit disconcerting, because they did not react to federal government interference in the health field.  
If one asked any of the government party members, whether from Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia or Saskatchewan, to point out the place where the constitution, which is supposed to strike a balance between the power of the provinces and of the federal government, states that the federal government is allowed to get involved in the health field, I am willing to bet that no one over there could find such a thing, because it is not there.  
They just waded in to do their dirty work, with no hesitation whatsoever. 
I will give some examples of this. 
There is the creation of the Canadian institute of health research, an expenditure of $65 million by the year 2001 and another $175 million in 2001-2002. 
The federal government wants to get into the health research and development field.  
Would it not have been more respectful of the provinces' powers to say ``We are going to transfer the available funding''. 
There is no denying that the federal government has plenty of money at this time. 
Of course, these funds can be considered ill gotten gains, because the government passed its deficit on to the provinces.  
At present, the federal government has a lot of money. 
If it had wanted to put it to good use, it could easily have transferred to the provinces funds that would have enabled them to fund research in the health sector, because we all agree that it is important to do research in that area.  
Our population is aging, and seniors are living longer. 
We all have a pretty good chance of living until the age of 85, 90 or 95. 
I do not want to exaggerate, but the fact is that people are living longer.  
Another example of federal intrusion is the research and evaluation fund for nursing staff. 
The government will spend $25 million on this over a 10 year period. 
Then there is the Canadian institute of health research, which will get $328 million to improve health information systems by applying modern technology. 
In short, the government's attitude is brazen, impolite, disrespectful and shocking, and all those who have some backbone in this House should be outraged. 
Of course, this excludes a good half of the membership here.  
Be that as it may, if the government had wanted to do something useful, it could easily have accepted a number of the Quebec government's legitimate demands. 
This is a democratically elected government, one of the best we have had in a long time in the National Assembly.  
I will give the example of the Montreal convention centre. 
Montreal is an international city, and a hub for the tourist industry. 
Montreal, and Quebec City of course-and I see my colleague from the Quebec City region nodding in approval-are both very important tourist destinations.  
The Government of Quebec is going ahead and enlarging the Montreal congress centre, because it realizes that additional space is required for a number of important congresses that are planned years in advance. 
Reservations have already been taken for 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. 
Organizers of a congress-not a simple convention, but an international congress-must obviously begin their preparations a few years in advance.  
Ottawa gives every impression of being a patronage, with the Minister of Industry giving Ottawa's congress centre priority over Montreal's.  
The Government of Quebec decided to go ahead and expand the Montreal congress centre on its own. 
Now we must pay for this expansion. 
The Government of Canada owes Quebec exactly $58 billion. 
We would appreciate payment in the next few weeks.  
Here is an area where the government had some leeway, but did nothing. 
When it comes to Quebec's interests, there will always be people on the government side ready to steamroller over them. 
If the Bloc Quebecois were not here in Ottawa, who would represent Quebec's interests? 
Certainly not the Liberal members from Quebec, who epitomize the ``silence of the lambs''.  
We are still waiting for our $1 billion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member- 
Mr. Réal Ménard:
Madam Speaker, I had 20 minutes, not 10. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I was given to understand the hon. member would be sharing his time. 
Go on.  
Mr. Réal Ménard:
We all need a little encouragement in this House.  
During the ice storm, the people in Quebec came together in a show of solidarity and everyone gave a helping hand. 
Although in a tight situation, the Government of Quebec agreed to loosen the purse strings. 
There are overdue payments with regard to the ice storm:
Quebeckers are being denied $435 million, because the federal government argues that the expenditures incurred by Hydro-Québec to undertake emergency measures and rebuild its infrastructure are not covered by the federal disaster relief program.  
When will the Liberals play fair with the Quebec government? 
That is the question.  
We could talk about Oka. 
The Government of Quebec is still waiting for a $38 million cheque to cover expenditures the province considers eligible under the federal disaster relief program.  
Is there anything more important in a modern society that R&D?  
I am glad to see that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is showing some concern. 
I have some consideration for the minister of course because she is a charming lady, but also because she had the courage to apologize, on behalf of the Government of Canada, and that she is working now on a plan of reconciliation with the aboriginal people.  
I hope the minister will not forget that, if there ever was a government on this earth that has worked, that has recognized aboriginal governments, and that has paid tribute to, made things easier for and given space to aboriginal communities, to the first nations, because they are nations, it is the Government of Quebec that did it, as early as 1985.  
In a sovereign Quebec, within a matter of months, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development knows that we will treat all the aboriginal communities on Quebec territory on an equal footing. 
The Erasmus commission urged the government to do the same. 
I hope that this call will be heard, but I still think that the minister stands apart from the rest of the government, which is quite unimpressive. 
She is like a breath of fresh air in an all too dreary situation.  
I also want to raise the whole issue of social housing. 
Eighty-nine per cent of my constituents are tenants, not owner-occupants. 
In the 1996 speech from the throne, the government had committed to decentralizing certain powers. 
Among the commitments that the government had made at that time, $1.9 billion was to be redistributed to the provinces for social housing. 
What has happened since that speech from the throne? 
Nothing happened in the case of the Government of Quebec. 
It is not because the Quebec government was not ready to negotiate or refused to take over that responsibility. 
Since Quebec is already responsible for the Civil Code and for land use management, it would only be normal for it to also take over responsibility for social housing.  
You will not believe what I am about to say. 
The federal government wants to transfer $300 million, which is ridiculous, when Quebec can rightfully claim more than $500 million. 
No one.  
I ask the minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to initiate negotiations, to negotiate in good faith and to give Quebec its due share.  
I would like to address my comments to all Liberal members. 
Tomorrow there will be an important vote on a motion to add social condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
In fact, this is a private member's bill introduced by the hon. member for Shefford, whom we wish to commend. 
Government members could seize this opportunity to create an additional tool to fight poverty.  
This explains why some Canadians are still victims of discrimination in terms of access to financial services, housing and, indeed, under the employment insurance legislation. 
Our bet is that taking action to put an end to discrimination, by adding social condition to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination for instance, would contribute in a significant and realistic way to improve the condition of the less fortunate.  
I am ready to bet that, tomorrow, all government members will rise and vote against the bill introduced by the member for Shefford. 
Canadian citizens will not forget that this government was not concerned about poverty and would not take concrete action to fight poverty.  
It is high time we, as parliamentarians, enabled those who are discriminated against, at least those who do in federal jurisdictions, to put an end to it.  
If government members were to vote against the bill, I predict that a standoff, an all out war would result, because we in the Bloc Quebecois will never tolerate so much insensitivity on their part with respect to the fight against poverty.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased the member included in his remarks comments with regard to poverty in Canada. 
I think all members will agree that the best way to approach a problem is first to understand it.  
The member will know of some current research, for instance the research study of the Golden task force on the homelessness situation. 
It identified that 35% of the homeless in Toronto were mentally ill, which I expect is reflective of other urban communities across the country; 28% were youth who had been alienated from their families, and of those 70% had experienced physical or sexual abuse; 10% were abused women; and 18% were aboriginals off reserve. 
That accounts for a very significant proportion, over 80% of the homeless in Toronto.  
The member well knows this is a symptom of poverty but is not the sole cause. 
There is not a simple solution to poverty and homelessness in Canada. 
Mr. Réal Ménard:
Madam Speaker, I agree with a number of the comments made by our colleague.  
I would, however, invite him to understand that, when it comes to analyzing the phenomenon of poverty, it must be realized that there is a kind of fault line that dates back to the early 1990s.  
A link must be made to poverty-and the hon. member is right to point out that this is a phenomenon in the major cities for the most part-and particularly the poverty created by certain measures. 
If he hon. member wants to raise this issue, he might make an extremely useful contribution to the debate, first of all by asking his government to amend not only the Canadian Human Rights Act, but the Employment Insurance Act as well.  
The hon. member must be aware that, because of his government's employment insurance legislation, 200,000 people across Canada have had to make use of last resort solutions. 
There are, of course, many causes of poverty. 
There is the matter of housing, the matter of outdated skills. 
People who have been skilled workers in the clothing, the textile or the petrochemical industries, which have been in decline internationally since the early 1980s and the 1990s, find themselves out of the workforce, and it is hard to get back in.  
I would remind our colleague that it was his government that abolished the older workers adjustment program, known as POWA. 
I invite him therefore to give some more thought to the poverty created by governments, the one he belongs to in particular.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of brief comments with respect to my hon. colleague's remarks. 
He spoke to the issue of Bill S-11 which was introduced by the member for Shefford and sponsored originally by Senator Cohen in the Senate.  
Establishing social condition in the Canadian bill of human rights was something a number of provinces across the country have done. 
Given that the Minister of Justice just the other week made comments indicating that social condition should at least be considered or studied to be added to the charter of human rights, would the member not think that by not supporting Bill S-11 on this occasion and perhaps doing it down the road is an indication that the government prefers a bit of partisanship as opposed to doing the right thing and voting for Bill S-11 right away?  
Mr. Réal Ménard:
Madam Speaker, our colleague is right to remind us that there are times in parliament when we must rise above partisanship.  
One of those very important times is, of course, when we talk about human rights. 
Had it been a government bill, I believe we would still have supported it unconditionally.  
What is social condition? 
The way the courts have defined social condition refers to three elements: one's position in society based on one's income; one's position in society based on one's education; and the prejudice one suffers as a result of those positions.  
Based on the rulings handed down by the courts, it is clear that welfare recipients have a particular social condition. 
It must be noted that the debate on social condition is not an academic debate. 
It has a very concrete meaning for those people who would be able to challenge not only a number of discriminatory practices related to the services they receive, but also discriminatory measures taken by governments as the case may be.  
Again, I urge all members-and I am sure my colleague, the member for Shefford, would do the same if she were here today-to vote tomorrow in favour of this bill that would improve the Canadian Human Rights Act and that would send a clear message to all Canadians that we do not accept discrimination, no matter which forms it takes.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, we can always count on the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for a lively speech. 
He cited all sorts of information and figures in his speech, but I heard no mention of the figures in this budget for the equalization payments. 
I wonder whether the member could speak to us about that a bit.  
Mr. Réal Ménard:
I cannot quite agree that there is nothing new.  
I think he will understand that the issue is not whether it is new or old. 
It is about telling the truth. 
I think our colleague will agree that each of the matters we have raised is based on an enlightened understanding of the interests of Quebec. 
The member may find it old hat to talk about poverty. 
I hope, like him, that a day will come when we do not have to debate it in the House because it will have been eliminated. 
However, to get to that point, there will need to be a lot more courage and lucidity in his caucus and a good dollop of co-operation among the opposition parties. 
The member is right. 
We are not there, even in our boldest fantasies about the Government of Canada.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, we have been listening to the Liberal spin on the budget since February. 
The fact is there are two stories. 
I will go through a few of the spin stories of the Liberals and then the other story and the facts.  
The Liberals claim they are giving Canadians $1.5 billion in tax relief this year, $2.8 billion next year and $3.4 billion by 2001-02 for a total of about $7.7 billion. 
That is their story. 
At the same time Canadians are getting less health care. 
An hon member:
His nose is growing.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
The truth hurts. 
I can hear them squealing over there. 
The truth really hurts.  
That is what this Liberal government wants Canadians to feel good about.  
In the Liberal spin story on health care the Liberals claim they will invest $1.4 billion over three years for federal health care initiatives. 
They claim they will invest $11.5 billion over the next five years in payments to the provinces in CHST transfers. 
That is the Liberal story.  
Here is the real story. 
There has been a 31% drop in taxpayer health and social spending by the federal government. 
The Liberals have cut health and social spending by 34% per taxpayer since 1993. 
Here is another one the Liberals will not tell us about. 
There is 188,000 Canadians on waiting lists for serious operations and health care services. 
Is this the real story? 
Liberals claim they expect to retire $20 billion in market debt this year. 
That is the Liberal story. 
Here are the facts. 
This country's net debt is still a staggering $580 billion, or $18,800 for every single Canadian. 
Every time a baby is born in this country, he or she automatically owes $18,800.  
Why have we seen our health care cut? 
Why have we seen these high taxes? 
Because the previous Liberal governments since 1965 or so and the short term Tory government of Brian Mulroney have run up such a debt to the extent that every single year the government has to pay out $42.5 billion in interest payments on that debt.  
What could we do with that kind of money, $42.5 billion? 
We could probably fund the entire health care system for about three years. 
We could probably pay the tuition fees for every student in post-secondary education in Canada today for their entire education period.  
The spin doctors and the Liberals have been busy, but Canadians simply are not buying that story.  
The Liberals will increase spending by $7.6 billion.  
This is the government that said it was important to get spending under control. 
Every year since 1993 the government has increased spending and over the last year by over $7.5 billion in increased spending, or $23 billion over the next three years.  
This is a government that told Canadians it was crucial to get spending under control, yet it has increased spending. 
Let me say those numbers again. 
We cannot get our financial house in order unless we stop spending the money, and spending the money in some very foolish ways I might add. 
Instead of spending it on health care, the Liberals are content to spend a couple of billion dollars on a millennium monument to the prime minister. 
I could go on. 
The member for St. Albert who does the waste report knows all about Liberal spending.  
Let us look at this one. 
The Liberals claim they are investing $1.8 billion in research and development over the next four years. 
The fact is we want our brightest and our best to stay in this country. 
The best thing they can do for research and development is to give Canadians tax breaks so the brightest and the best do not go south of the line where they have a much more enjoyable tax regime.  
The Liberals claim they are investing $400 million to address compensation and benefits issues in the Department of National Defence. 
They are going to spend $400 million. 
Here is the real story. 
Since 1993, the Liberals have cut $7 billion out of funding for our armed forces. 
They have continuously been asking our troops to do more with less. 
They are going to give them back $400 million, but they have taken away $7 billion since 1993. 
This budget is not what the Liberals would like Canadians to believe it is.  
The Speaker:
Of course, my colleague, you still have time left. 
I understand there are going to be questions and comments. 
You will have the floor when we resume debate, but right now we will go to Statements by Members.  
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
THE LATE SENATOR PAUL DAVID 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that we learned, on April 5, that senator Paul David, who founded the Montreal Heart Institute in the fifties, had passed away.  
Dr. David was a world renowned cardiologist, who was also firmly committed to social action. 
He was the founder of the heart and stroke foundations of Canada and Quebec, of which he was also a president.  
Dr. David received an impressive number of honours and awards throughout his brilliant career, both here and abroad.  
A true pioneer in his field, he was only 35 when he founded, in 1954, in Montreal's east end, the famous heart institute that he ran in various capacities until his retirement, in 1984. 
It was under his direction that the first heart transplant ever performed in Canada was carried out at the institute, in 1968.  
We offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Dr. Yvette Lemire, and his children, François, Pierre, Charles-Philippe, Thérèse, Anne-Marie and Hélène.  
* * * 
KOSOVO 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the humanitarian situation in Kosovo is a catastrophe. 
Men, women and children are fleeing in every direction to escape the misery.  
We as Canadians have a tradition of supporting human rights and the plight of refugees. 
We have opened our doors to them in the past and stand ready to do it again today.  
We know that if the soldiers are called upon, they will serve with pride and honour. 
They are trained, they are prepared, they are ready to serve.  
Our hearts go out to our service men and women and their families who are preparing in case they may be separated to force a peace on warring factions in a faraway land. 
I want them to know that the thoughts and prayers of Canadians are with them at this most stressful time.  
* * * 
THE LATE OMER DESLAURIERS 
Mr. Réginald Bélair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Ontario Francophonie lost one of its greatest champions.  
Omer Deslauriers, the former president of the Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario, former president of the Regroupement des intervenants professionnels franco-ontariens de la santé et des services sociaux, and the first president of the Council for Franco-Ontarian Affairs, worked tirelessly throughout his career to promote the cause of French Ontario.  
Through his passion and perseverance, Omer Deslauriers, who became a Member of the Order of Canada in 1996 and was named Person of the year by the Richelieu International club in 1997, helped Franco-Ontarians play a more prominent role at the provincial level, particularly in the areas of education and health.  
French Ontario has lost a remarkable spokesperson. 
It goes without saying that he will be missed.  
I want to extend my most sincere condolences to his family.  
* * * 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Government of Canada, I want to convey our heartfelt sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of the victims of Tuesday's horrible outburst of violence in Ottawa.  
Canadians have been shocked and numbed by this awful event. 
Our sadness and grief, in particular the sadness and grief of the victims' loved ones, are made more acute and painful by the senselessness of it all. 
To the families and friends of Clare Davidson, Brian Guay, Dave Lemay and Harry Schoenmakers, I want to say we in this House share your sorrow and pain. 
One brief eruption of madness has caused your lives to be changed forever. 
If it is any consolation, your community is with you and is ready to help in whatever way it can.  
I also want to commend the bus drivers and the other employees of OC Transpo who are endeavouring under very trying circumstances to deliver a service to the residents of Ottawa-Carleton. 
They are demonstrating tremendous courage and selflessness.  
* * * 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in keeping with the tribute just read, the deaths of those five OC Transpo employees last week were senseless and heartbreaking.  
Four innocent citizens of this community were killed by a lone gunman, leaving behind families, friends and co-workers who face the near impossible task of moving forward without them. 
To those closest to Harry Schoenmakers, Dave Lemay, Clare Davidson and Brian Guay, we offer our sincere and heartfelt support during this difficult healing process.  
Pierre Lebrun, the gunman, took his own life that day and leaves behind a grieving mother. 
For the Lebrun family, the burden of this tragic event rests heavily and we must offer our support to them as well.  
No law or social system could have predicted or prevented what took place and there are no guarantees that such an incident will not occur again.  
* * * 
THE LATE JACQUES GIRARD 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday we were saddened to hear of the death of Quebec's chief electoral officer, Jacques Girard, at the age of 41, following a long illness.  
Mr. Girard succeeded Pierre-F. 
He was a talented individual known for his conscientious and rigorous performance of his duties, whether in the legal services of Quebec's chief electoral officer, or in Quebec's Department of Revenue.  
Mr. Girard was devoted to the democratic process. 
He knew that our electoral process guarantees the legitimacy of our political system and he ensured the full integrity of that process. 
In person, and through his position, he therefore epitomized the most noble instincts of every Quebecker and Canadian.  
We extend our deepest condolences to the members of his family.  
* * * 
GRAND RIVER 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this year marks the fifth anniversary that the Grand River was named a Canadian heritage river.  
Community efforts under the guidance of the Grand River Conservation Authority have improved the health of the Grand River watershed, increased heritage awareness and fostered a greater understanding of ecotourism.  
The GRCA provides technical assistance to landowners, community groups, schools and municipalities through workshops, volunteer events, information products and logistics.  
Since 1990 visits to the Grand River have increased 30% with 1.1 million visitors in 1998 alone. 
This has led to new jobs and economic benefits to communities all along the Grand River, including my riding of Cambridge.  
I congratulate the GRCA on its ongoing success.  
* * * 
KOSOVO 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, very few people want war and most would avoid it at at almost any cost.  
In the case of Kosovo, most Canadians agree that our involvement with NATO is a better option than allowing killing and persecution of Kosovar Albanians to continue and accelerate.  
Most of us take our position more as observers than as participants, but the men and women of the Canadian forces are involved in a very direct and real way. 
As of yesterday we have close to 200 pilots and support personnel from 4 Wing, Cold Lake, which is in my riding, serving out of Italy. 
This means that families are separated for long periods of time, leaving spouses and children of pilots and ground crew wondering if their husbands, fathers, wives and mothers will return safely.  
At the same time as we take pride that our personnel are among the world's best, we are also very concerned for their safety. 
I know that my heart and my prayers are with our members and their families as they serve this noble cause.  
I have a special message to the personnel serving out of Cold Lake: ``serve well and come home safely''.  
* * * 
WESTERN PROVINCES 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report to the House that the Prime Minister's task force on the four western provinces, which I chair, spent the Easter break meeting and consulting with Manitobans.  
The response to this initiative was overwhelming. 
Over three days, task force members met with over 60 individuals and organizations across the province. 
Manitobans spoke to us about issues as diverse as the plight of our aboriginal peoples, the need for another infrastructure program, immigration issues and social programs.  
This initiative was announced to complement the work of our western caucus and give western Canadians another opportunity to shape the national agenda as the government nears the middle of our second mandate.  
The response we had throughout Manitoba proves one thing, western Canadians welcome opportunities to have input into the government's decision making process. 
I look forward to our future visits to Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. 
On behalf of the task force members, I would like to thank all those Manitobans who took the time to come and speak to us.  
* * * 
NOUVELLE SCÈNE 
Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, after ten years of hard work and a lengthy fundraising campaign, a great dream has been realized today.  
Today, a theatre for Ottawa's French speaking community is opening up on King Edward Avenue. 
The Nouvelle Scène will now house, under one roof, the Théâtre du Trillium, the Compagnie Vox Théâtre, the Théâtre de la Vieille 17, and the Théâtre de la Catapulte.  
The Nouvelle Scène will also host francophone theatre companies from the region, Canada and French speaking countries throughout the world.  
I wish the Nouvelle Scène every success and I urge my colleagues to pay it a visit and enjoy some great theatre. 
Break a leg, as they say.  
* * * 
THE LATE JACQUES GIRARD 
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Quebec and Canada lost a great shaper of democracy.  
On April 10, at the early age of 41, Jacques Girard, the directeur général des élections du Québec and head of the Commission de la représentation électorale, died of cancer.  
Appointed to these duties by the National Assembly last July 13, Mr. Girard earned the respect and admiration of all the members of his team, and all political parties, with the high degree of competency and enthusiasm he put into this work, and his big heart.  
Not only was Jacques Girard appreciated in Quebec, of course, but he was also greatly appreciated in Canada, where he occupied the position of Director of Legal Services at Elections Canada from 1992 to 1998. He also made a name abroad with his participation in technical assistance and observation missions in elections in many countries such as Russia, Haiti and Mexico.  
* * * 
YUGOSLAVIA 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, today we will have what is called a take note debate in the House of Commons about what is happening in Yugoslavia.  
The details of the procedure have yet to be finalized, but what is absolutely clear is that many Canadians feel that parliament has not adequately dealt with this issue, that somehow our way of dealing with such issues is not commensurate with their importance.  
This government's record on meaningfully consulting the House of Commons when it comes to NATO matters is not a good one. 
For example, we were the only NATO country whose parliament did not formally debate the expansion of NATO.  
The NDP calls on the government to be open to more meaningful debate and urges that at the very least the Minister of Foreign Affairs make a ministerial statement in the House tomorrow after he comes back from Brussels.  
* * * 
MONTFORT HOSPITAL 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, in this Année canadienne de la francophonie, Gisèle Lalonde and SOS Montfort are in court today to achieve recognition of the rights of Ontario francophones to their health institutions, and to the maintenance of the only francophone hospital west of the Ottawa River.  
The Bloc Quebecois has been pleased to provide its support to the efforts of Ontario francophones on behalf of the survival of this health care facility, which is also a French language teaching hospital.  
It is unacceptable that francophones in the rest of Canada must go to court in order to gain recognition of their most essential rights, to receive an education and health care in their language, at a time when the French speaking community in Canada is more fragile than ever, as the latest census data prove.  
The Bloc Quebecois wishes to assure Gisèle Lalonde, the Montfort Hospital board, and the franco-Ontarian community, of Quebeckers' support in their efforts to gain respect for their fundamental rights.  
* * * 
MEMBER FOR WHITBY-AJAX 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, fellow members of parliament, I am back.  
I want to thank the hundreds of you who sent get well wishes to me in Germany during my 27 day stay at the Johanniter Krachenhaus hospital in Bonn, and then upon my return to Canada in mid-February.  
I am pleased to report that I am well on the way to a full recovery.  
I return to parliament with a renewed appreciation for our health care system without which an episode such as I have recently experienced may well have bankrupt both me and my family.  
I also want to express my deepest appreciation to Professor Moebius and his medical team, to the staff of the Canadian embassy in Bonn, and most particularly Ambassador Gaetan Lavertu and Dennis Lance who made daily visits to my bedside with news from home.  
I want to send a very special thank you to the residents of Whitby-Ajax who kept both florists and card companies flourishing.  
I also take this opportunity to publicly thank my staff here and in the riding for their tremendous efforts on behalf of my constituents during my time of illness.  
The Speaker:
Welcome home, Judi.  
* * * 
NATIONAL POST 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, fine whine was the highlight of the commentary section in Saturday's National Post .  
Readers were subjected to the same tired excuses from the Prime Minister as to why a convicted criminal and an admitted embezzler under investigation got $2.3 million in federal grants and loans for hotel projects in his riding.  
Pathetic protests from the Prime Minister do nothing to restore public confidence, especially when Liberal cabinet ministers and backbenchers do much to prevent Parliament from uncovering the truth.  
Instead of writing a four page missive to the National Post , why will the Prime Minister not prove his integrity by tabling all documents in the possession of his office on his involvement in the Duhaime and Thibault projects? 
Better yet, why will he not invoke section 11 of the Auditor General Act to direct that office to conduct an independent audit of both deals? 
Anything less makes the Prime Minister's whine of integrity taste very sour.  
* * * 
TORONTO LODGE 1600 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on Friday, March 19, I had the honour of attending the grand opening of Toronto Lodge No. 1600 of the Loyal Order of Moose. 
Toronto Lodge 1600 has been in existence for 84 years but this occasion marked the first time that the lodge has owned its own building.  
During the evening's festivities, certificates were presented to those members of the community who helped make this grand opening possible. 
The following people and organizations were honoured for their contributions:
Torbram Electric, Lawrence Cohen, Tom Campagnolo Construction, Trevor Gabb, Canada Cartage, Mike Mastrotucci, Al McWhirter, Larry Huard, Ken McCalla, Innovative Securities, Vera-Ann Kalbol and Dennis Packer of Unistar Communications.  
Organizations such as the Toronto lodge have made community service a cornerstore of their every day life. 
They are hard at work giving their time and effort to make our community a better place to live by supporting both local and international charitable organizations and programs.  
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
KOSOVO 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians across the country generally support Canada's involvement in the NATO campaign to stop Serb aggression in Kosovo. 
They want to see ethnic Albanians resettled to live in peace and democracy in Kosovo.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say thanks for the support that all the parties have given to activities of the Canadian Armed Forces in NATO.  
This morning when the minister was in Brussels he took the message that has been the same since the beginning. 
We want to make sure that it is possible for the Kosovars to go home safely, that the ethnic cleansing Mr. Milosevic started more than a year ago is terminated as quickly as possible, and that we maintain the plan which was agreed to by all members of NATO some weeks ago.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and other senior American officials called Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic a war criminal. 
The American president's chief of staff called for his removal from office as a necessary precondition of Serbia's regaining its status as a democratic nation.  
Does the government support these statements? 
If so, how do we negotiate for peace with a leader who has been labelled a war criminal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of the Canadian government is that we want all criminals who have caused the genocide in Serbia and in the neighbouring nations to face the trial that is called by the international community. 
There was a resolution to that effect. 
This is one of the problems we are having with Milosevic and his government. 
They do not want to return the criminals to face justice and we insist that they do that.  
In the meantime the government in Belgrade is run by Milosevic. 
That is the government which exists at this moment in that country. 
If it wants to sign a peace agreement, even if it is Milosevic, we should take it. 
If he is a war criminal he should face the consequences of his actions in the international court.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today in Brussels some officials conceded that most of the original Rambouillet peace framework had been overtaken by events and would not rule out partitioning Kosovo as part of any settlement.  
Is the government considering supporting the partitioning of Kosovo as part of any negotiated settlement to resolve the crisis in the Balkans?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we want all Kosovars anywhere and everywhere to be able to go back home to Kosovo. 
They have been there a long time. 
There is no discussion at this time about partitioning Kosovo as part of the deal.  
We want all Kosovars to be able to go back to their homes where they have been for a long time and to have their lives and freedom protected.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the majority of Canadians appear to possibly support the use of ground forces in Kosovo, but they want to be kept informed about just what the government is doing.  
Last week the defence minister said that Canada was considering sending ground forces to Kosovo in advance of the peace agreement, but the Prime Minister denied that there were any such plans.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Is the government considering sending Canadian ground forces into Kosovo?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no discussion at this time at the ministerial level of any possibility of sending troops in a combat position into Kosovo. 
This is not something that is on the table and it is not being considered by the government.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is certainly being considered by other governments in the NATO allies and it is certainly the topic of conversation in military circles. 
It is the number one concern of the military. 
It is the number one concern of the official opposition.  
Again my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Is the government considering sending Canadian ground forces to Kosovo in advance of a peace agreement?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have replied to that question. 
We are not considering such a move at all at this moment.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says he is not planning to send ground troops to Kosovo.  
However, in the present state of affairs, with the air strikes dragging on longer than expected, is it not completely reasonable to consider what will happen if ground troops become necessary?  
Will the Prime Minister tell us whether his cabinet and chief of defence staff are considering sending ground troops, if warranted, or if this scenario is excluded a priori?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are acting in concert with other countries.  
As I said earlier, there is no question at this time of sending ground troops to Kosovo. 
None at all. 
We do not need to make a decision about this as long as the problem does not arise.  
Our plan is to continue with the bombing. 
We must stick with this course of action.  
I am in agreement with the stepped up bombing that began a few days ago.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I note that the Prime Minister's response is to say that ``there is no question at this time of sending ground troops'', and I agree.  
However, it is not on the eve of sending them that we will be called upon to evaluate whether or not troops are necessary. 
In my view, the Prime Minister is suggesting that such an evaluation is now under way.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is our third debate on the topic since October.  
I can assure the hon. member that if, one day, we are obliged-I hope it never comes to that-to send ground troops, I will be happy to hold another debate in the House of Commons at that time.  
Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence said recently that it would be a few weeks, if not several months, before the Canadian army was ready to intervene in Kosovo.  
Since many people are seriously raising the issue of land operations, could the minister tell us about the army's readiness at this point to intervene in Kosovo?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister has said, we have one plan. 
We have an air campaign. 
We believe that the air campaign will work. 
We believe that the conditions set down again today in Brussels by NATO need to be met and we will continue with that campaign.  
Of course military planners always look at different possibilities, but there is one plan and one plan only that is being followed by NATO and being followed by Canada.  
Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I invite the minister to listen carefully to my question. 
I have twice asked him questions, and he does not always give me a direct answer.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Those troops are in training now and will be available to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo once the conditions laid down by NATO are adhered to by the Yugoslav government. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government has been counting on military actions alone to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
Because of the military focus, political solutions have been virtually ignored with 19 days of bombing but no real diplomatic leadership.  
Will the government now agree to show the leadership Canadians expect and push for a United Nations led negotiated solution?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, nothing would be more pleasant for the government than to have an agreement with the United Nations on this problem. 
Our ambassador in New York has been active. 
I think it is very important to involve the Russians in a solution as much as possible. 
I have written to Mr. Yeltsin to that effect. 
The reality is that both Russia and China have a veto at the security council and we cannot move.  
I was very pleased with the statement of Secretary General Koffi Annan yesterday when he confirmed that his personal position was the same as that of NATO as stated this morning on the condition to have a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canada is bombing Serbia with the objective of protecting the civilian population of Kosovo, but the ethnic cleansing continues.  
Is Canada prepared to advance the proposition that if Milosevic will stop the atrocities, stop the killing and agree to come to the table, NATO will suspend the bombing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one of the conditions mentioned in the five conditions agreed upon is to make sure he stops this cleansing and withdraws his soldiers so the Kosovars can go back home under secure conditions.  
He does not want to do that. 
He started the policy of cleansing against the Kosovars months before we had the Rambouillet negotiations. 
Despite the agreement of the Russians on the Rambouillet conditions, he refused to sign and kept with his policy of pushing the Kosovars out and killing probably hundreds of thousands of them. 
That is why we have to maintain pressure on him with intensification of the air strikes.  
Mr. André Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, in 1991 when the international community under the UN flag was about to strike against Iraq, the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister who was personally briefed by the prime minister accused him of rolling the dice with Canadian lives during a real debate on a votable motion.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week the government House leader negotiated the form of today's debate, and all parties, including the Progressive Conservative Party, agreed to a debate like the one we will be having.  
This is the practice we have followed since we first formed the government. 
Every time there have been Canadian military interventions somewhere, we have always come to the House of Commons before going further and we are continuing to do so. 
We have always had this sort of debate.  
Mr. André Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister should check his facts. 
There will be no petty politics, but he should put real politics at the service of Canadians and the Kosovar people and have a real debate in parliament.  
The Prime Minister is not up to date, but we turned down a debate like the other two debates. 
What parliament needs is to speak officially. 
What is going on in Kosovo is serious.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, far from being afraid, we organized briefings for all of the parties.  
Mr. André Bachand:
That is not true.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
They should resolve their problems and then come back to the House.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has said that the government is not considering committing Canadian ground troops to NATO action in the Balkans. 
Should that position change, will the Prime Minister commit to submitting that issue to a vote-not a discussion, not a debate, but a vote-in this Chamber?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have developed a system that is working very well. 
We have consulted more departments. 
We have established this route. 
The member is asking the question ``Should there be a vote if troops were to be sent to engage in combat?'' 
That is the question. 
We are not there. 
When that question comes I will seriously consider the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a simple question that requires a yes or a no from the Prime Minister.  
In 1991 when the Conservative government committed troops to the war in the gulf the Prime Minister was on his feet demanding that there be a vote in this House and saying it was illegal when they did not get the vote.  
I ask the Prime Minister again:
Will the government agree to a vote in this House before committing Canadian ground troops to any action in the Balkans?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a hypothetical question and I have replied as favourably as possible. 
We are not faced with that situation. 
I said, and I repeat, that if we are faced with that situation I will consider it positively and I will give the answer when confronted with the problem.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, following the meeting of NATO's foreign affairs ministers in Brussels this morning, the French and Belgian ministers of Foreign Affairs stated that the idea of creating some kind of international protectorate for Kosovo was discussed among allies.  
Could the Prime Minister tell us whether Canada intends to promote this solution, or will it continue reacting to events as it has been doing since the beginning of this conflict?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in the search for a solution to this problem, we are not ruling out any option.  
Then, there is the issue of Kosovo's political status. 
Kosovo enjoyed a high degree of autonomy until President Milosevic took it away in 1989. 
What will the political solution be? 
We are prepared to look at every option.  
But the important thing is to ensure that Kosovars can safely go back home and live a normal life.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, could the Prime Minister tell us whether he plans to finally take advantage of the fact that Canada sits at the UN security council by suggesting to the other members of the security council the creation of some kind of international protectorate for Kosovo?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
All the suggestions that will be made will be reviewed by the minister and by the ambassador, and they will be discussed when there is a chance for a positive solution at the security council, which is something we all hope for.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, just a minute ago we heard the Prime Minister refuse to commit to sending this issue to a vote in the House of Commons. 
We are talking about sending the sons and daughters of Canadian citizens into a possible combat situation. 
I do not understand what the problem is. 
This is the most democratic Chamber in the country. 
Why is the Prime Minister refusing to allow this issue to be considered? 
Why is he refusing to commit today that we will have a vote on this issue when it actually comes into being? 
Why is the Prime Minister refusing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I said there would be a debate if we faced that question. 
I said that at the beginning and there will be a debate.  
At this time I want to debate what is going on today because the priority of the government is to make sure that we have a peaceful situation there and that we will not need to send combat troops there. 
That is the goal of the government.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is well and good, but the fact is that any responsible government would look down the road. 
A responsible government would show somehow that it is committed to democracy.  
When we are talking about an issue that is this serious, I submit that the Prime Minister has a responsibility to declare right now that he will put this issue to a vote. 
Will he make that commitment?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want at this time to make sure that the plan we have agreed to with the countries of NATO will work and that Milosevic will permit the people to go back to Kosovo and live in security. 
Of course if there is a peace agreement Canada will want to participate in a peacekeeping operation.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, right at the beginning of his response to the first question, the Prime Minister stated that he was proud to have the support of all parties in this House. 
I think that, indeed, all parties support the government's actions, with a few reservations of course.  
What we are quite simply asking him is this: in order to conserve this necessary support, can he commit today to holding a vote in this House, should we need to send troops to Kosovo, before a decision is taken?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again, we are having a debate today to discuss the situation in Kosovo. 
That is where the crisis is at the present time, and we must ensure that the Kosovars can return home under the best possible conditions.  
That is the debate we are having today. 
I can see the members of the opposition do not want to debate that. 
What they want to debate is a situation we do not wish to see occur. 
The last thing we want to have to do is send land forces over.  
Canada wishes to have a peaceable position, one which will enable Canadians to take part in peacekeeping operations.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are not refusing to allow such a debate and we do take it seriously. 
However, history has shown us that there has been significant division in Canada in the past when such decisions had to be taken.  
There is a greater unity than ever here on this question at this time, a first, on the question of Kosovo. 
We do not want to be in that situation again- 
The Speaker:
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what I said earlier is that there will be a debate in the House before we send any troops, but we hope not to have to send any. 
This is the objective and the wish of the government and, I hope, of all Canadians.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the Prime Minister that it was our defence minister who put on the table the possibility of Canadian ground troops going into Kosovo.  
We have a right in the House to know that Canadians' own representatives will give the go ahead before the lives of men and women are put on the line.  
It is shameful to see the Prime Minister skating around this issue and doing everything he can to deny a rightful vote in the Parliament of Canada on this important issue. 
Will he not just say right now that, yes, there will be a vote?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to repeat that they are asking a hypothetical question. 
I said that if I am confronted with that I will look at the question as positively as possible, but we are not there.  
I want members of the House of Commons to debate what the operations of NATO are at this time and what can be done to improve the situation to avoid sending ground troops into combat in Kosovo.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what has been done so far is that we get a chance after the fact to debate a fait accompli decision the government has already taken.  
We are demanding in the House that we have the right to have a democratic debate and vote before the lives of Canadian men and women are put further at risk. 
The defence minister has put that possibility on the table.  
On behalf of Canadians we want to be assured that the House will rule as to whether this goes ahead or not.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have had more debate on the involvement of Canadian troops around the world than ever before. 
We have taken every issue to the House, every time we were confronted, since we formed the government. 
If opposition members think the government is not doing its job, they can have a vote of non-confidence in the government.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, during the past week, the parliaments of Albania and the Republic of Macedonia appealed to us for help in taking in, feeding and housing Kosovar refugees.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Has the government already made commitments in this regard and does it intend to use the $100 million set aside to take the refugees in here to add to the help provided the NGOs?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, immediately after we received the call from the UN high commissioner for refugees asking us to provide a safe shelter for the Kosovars, the Prime Minister made a commitment to take in 5,000 Kosovars here in Canada, as we all know.  
The border situation has stabilized somewhat, and the high commissioner has halted all requests to countries to take people in temporarily. 
We have now been asked primarily to give consideration to family reunification and to respond to people with very special needs, which we are prepared to do.  
As to financial aid, we will clearly continue to help Albania and Macedonia.  
* * * 
NUNAVUT 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week all of Canada celebrated the creation of the new territory of Nunavut.  
Science and traditional knowledge are both essential to building a solid base for the future of the people of Nunavut.  
Can the Minister of Natural Resources tell the House what his department is doing to help the people of Nunavut in the area of research?  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me join with my fellow colleagues in congratulating the people of Nunavut and the hon. member, the great member for Nunavut, on the tremendous celebration. 
It was very well done indeed.  
The process of building Nunavut has only just begun. 
Natural Resources Canada has just increased funding by $1 million this fiscal year to the polar continental shelf project, which is Canada's primary science logistical project in northern Canada.  
* * * 
KOSOVO 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians are concerned with the Prime Minister's answers. 
The Prime Minister keeps saying he will do this or he may do that. 
Most Canadians believe that the House of Commons should make decisions about sending our soldiers into harm's way.  
Will he commit to that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. members are all asking hypothetical questions.  
I said that I hope we will never be confronted with that situation. 
I want to make sure that the House is very united. 
On this issue we have been very united. 
Any weakness or any division in the position of Canada will be used by Mr. Milosevic.  
We have made a commitment to our allies that this policy of ours is sustained by the Parliament of Canada. 
If the opposition wants to vote against it, it can have a motion tomorrow showing that it has no confidence in the government. 
At the same time, it will not be supporting- 
The Speaker:
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister saying that democracy and the exercise of democracy are weaknesses of Canada? 
I thought the primary reason we were in the Balkans was to try to restore democracy there. 
Demonstrating democracy is a strength, not a weakness.  
Why does the Prime Minister not just back up and commit that if we are going to involve Canadian forces in ground operations in the future in the Balkans, that he will submit that to a vote in the House prior to making that commitment?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has taken its position and we have agreed with the opposition to have a debate. 
We are having the debate today.  
An hon. member:
No vote.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
If the opposition wants to have a vote of non-confidence in the government, it is very easy. 
The opposition can have it.  
The Government of Canada has made commitments of a certain position to the allies. 
We have come to the House and all the parties have supported our position. 
If they think they do not want to support the position of the government, then it is very easy. 
Tomorrow is an opposition day and they can have a vote tomorrow saying that they do not agree with the position of the government.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, tragically the only message coming out of NATO in Brussels today was more air strikes and more bombing.  
I want to ask the Prime Minister, will Canada finally show real leadership on this issue? 
Will Canada call for an immediate suspension of NATO bombing and Milosevic's ethnic cleansing, a return to negotiations under UN auspices with a key role for Russia and very importantly, an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to seek a diplomatic solution to the devastating tragedy in Kosovo?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, NATO has been very clear right from the beginning about what it expects to bring about a cessation of the hostilities and a cessation of the bombing: ensure a verifiable stop to all military action; an immediate ending of violence and repression; ensure the withdrawal of Yugoslav military police and paramilitary forces; agree with the stationing of an international military presence; agree to the unconditional safe return of the refugees and displaced persons; and provide for a political framework for the future government. 
That is the kind of action plan that he has to agree to before the air campaign can stop.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the same minister.  
The Minister of National Defence just referred to an international military presence to ensure the safety of refugees returning to Kosovo. 
Last Friday this same minister said that presence had to be a NATO peacekeeping force.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what is important here is that the people of Kosovo are able to return to their homes and are able to live in peace and security. 
That is what is important. 
We need a military force there to ensure it. 
I believe we need a NATO led military force. 
That is the position of NATO.  
Can the United Nations help to resolve this problem? 
Can other countries help to resolve this problem? 
Yes, and I hope they would.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the former U.S. secretary of defence, Caspar Weinberger, said, in a personal capacity, that we had neither defined the victory nor established the real objectives in Kosovo.  
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
What are the immediate and long term goals for the NATO air strikes?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are there because we want the people of Kosovo to be able to live in peace and security in their home province. 
We want the ethnic cleansing to stop and the atrocities to stop. 
That is why we are there with the air campaign. 
The air campaign will continue until those conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are in fact met.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, on April 1, General Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme commander directing the air campaign, stated ``We can't stop paramilitary actions from the air. 
We never thought air power alone can stop this kind of paramilitary tragedy''. 
The U.S. joint chief staffs reportedly agree with General Clark's assessment that a bombing campaign will not work.  
What are the immediate long term goals of the NATO air campaign? 
Has the minister already made a commitment of ground troops to NATO?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe the air campaign will work, and so does General Clark.  
Additional resources are being put there. 
The Apache helicopter for example can go in at a lower level and deal with the ground forces of the Yugoslav government that are carrying out the ethnic cleansing. 
Our air campaign's purpose is to weaken and destroy the capability of the Yugoslav military to carry out ethnic cleansing.  
* * * 
HEALTH 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the last budget invested in the health of Canadians and in the health care system.  
We know that drugs are an increasingly important element of health care and that drug policies should ensure the right drug for the right patient at the right cost.  
How is the federal government helping to ensure that Canadians get access to drug therapies prescribed by their doctors?  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the minister is committed to doing everything he can to ensure that the people of Canada have access to the drugs they need. 
That is why a conference was held on pharmacare.  
As a result of that conference, it is very clear that any access to needed drug therapies must be done through the development of an integrated health model to ensure that we do not make the mistakes that have been made in the past which have often resulted in people not getting optimal drug therapy from the drugs they take.  
* * * 
KOSOVO 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in the event that the crisis in Kosovo escalates and ground troops are necessary, I would have to suggest that it is they who will lay their lives on the line. 
It would be good for our troops to know exactly where this parliament sits in support of any action that may be on the ground.  
Again, I ask the Prime Minister, why will he not commit to having a vote on the issue of sending ground troops into Kosovo should that need arise?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the problem which is confronting the government at this time.  
We want to make sure that the policies that have been accepted by NATO, and which are strongly supported by the Canadian government and obviously by the Canadian people, stop the ethnic cleansing that is going on and that Milosevic takes his troops out of Kosovo so the Kosovars can go back home in security.  
We do not want to start to debate the question on how we will handle the problem of sending ground troops. 
We do not want to send ground troops. 
We want Milosevic to accept and respect the people of Kosovo who want to be at home in Kosovo.  
Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this morning, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Brussels that we should set up a peacekeeping force in Kosovo, to ensure the implementation of an eventual solution to the current crisis.  
Can the Prime Minister tell us whether this peacekeeping force will be under the command of the UN, the OSCE, or NATO?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have not yet reached that point. 
When the Rambouillet accords were accepted by moderate Kosovars, it was anticipated that troops would be sent and we were prepared to take part in that operation.  
What will happen after we have obtained what we are seeking, that is peace and the safe return of Kosovars to their homes? 
Troops will be sent and Canada will want to participate. 
We hope it will be under the aegis of the United Nations. 
It would be ideal if everyone wanted to participate, including the Russians, the Chinese, etc. However, we do know that if they do not want to participate, we can still go with the support of NATO countries.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there has been some indication that weapons involving depleted uranium are being deployed by NATO forces in Kosovo presenting a danger to the people and to the environment of the entire Balkans.  
Will the minister advise this House as to whether depleted uranium is being used, in what capacity and by whom?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
* * * 
DISASTERS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, could the President of the Treasury Board clarify the financial assistance received by Quebec from the Government of Canada, under the disaster financial assistance arrangements?  
Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week, we sent Quebec a cheque of $175 million, for the damage incurred and for the compensation paid out to the population by the Government of Quebec. 
* * * 
KOSOVO 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I would like to remind the Prime Minister that we still live in a democracy and not a dictatorship. 
Will the Prime Minister give his consent before dispatching combat ground troops to Kosovo? 
Will the Prime Minister give us this undertaking today?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has made it abundantly clear numerous times that such a matter, if it happens to come about, would be discussed fully in this House.  
That is what we should be continuing to indicate and that is what we are determined to do. 
We will focus on that.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that the official opposition supports the NATO action in Kosovo. 
That is not open to question.  
What is this government so afraid of? 
What is the Prime Minister so afraid of that he will not commit here today to a vote on whether we are going to send ground troops to Kosovo?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have had more debate in the House of Commons on foreign affairs and the deployment of troops. 
We made an agreement with the opposition to have more debates on that. 
Now the opposition wants to change the agreement that we agreed on again last week.  
Let us deal with the problem we are confronted with today. 
We want the air strike to work. 
We want Milosevic to stop the ethnic cleansing and permit the Kosovars to go back home. 
This is the position of the government and it is the debate we are having at this time.  
I hope that the opposition, and I am very happy to see that they are back- 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Côte-de-Beaupré-Île-d'Orléans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Côte-de-Beaupré-Île-d'Orléans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Canada was to contribute between 600 and 800 troops to a peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the total number required being estimated at 45,000. 
For land operations like the ones being contemplated, far more ground troops would be needed.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
If Canada takes part in a land engagement, does it intend to increase its participation accordingly?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
If another proposal is made to us later, we shall see whether we need to step up our participation. 
However, the question is a purely hypothetical one at this point.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the right hon. Prime Minister.  
No one is asking for a premature debate on ground forces. 
No one is asking to debate hypothetical situations. 
We are asking for our right as a parliament should such decisions be made in the future. 
All we are asking is to have a vote, not a debate, not a discussion, not a take note debate, not an opposition day, not a vote of confidence, but a vote on a specific proposal by the government should it come to that.  
I ask the Prime Minister, what part of the word vote does he not understand? 
We are just asking for a vote. 
We vote on all kinds of things in this place. 
We just want a vote on that, should it come to it.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are having a debate. 
They want me to tell them today what we will do in years, months or days to come. 
I do not know.  
I said that I would seriously consider a vote at that time. 
I do not want to create an impression that we have divisions in Canada. 
We are debating the position of Canada in the Balkans today and I want the support of the House of Commons.  
If members want to vote they can do it tomorrow morning if they want. 
I thought the leaders of the parties were speaking for their parties. 
That is the way the government and parliament operate. 
It was agreed by all leaders that it was the way to debate these affairs. 
If they want to change the rules we will sit down with them but not before we are confronted with the problem of ground troops- 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for St. John's East.

REFUGEES 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, last week the minister of immigration stated that the federal government would cover all the costs of airlifting the 5,000 Kosovo refugees who were supposed to come to Canada. 
That cost was put at roughly $100 million.  
Would the minister be a little more clear? 
Now that the airlift has been cancelled, would the minister of immigration commit that $100 million to the various relief agencies so they can assist people living in very desperate conditions in these refugee camps?  
Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already responded. 
We have committed $22 million. 
We will continue to respond and work at the multilateral and bilateral levels. 
It is too soon to say how much it will cost us, but we know that much more needs to be done.  
The Speaker:
That would bring to a close our question period for today.  
Hon. Don Boudria:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would seek unanimous consent for the following motion: 
That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice, during consideration of Government Order, Government Business No. 23, any speech by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition may be followed by a ten minute period for questions and comments and the House shall continue to sit after 6.30 p.m. this day for the purpose of considering the said Government Order, provided that after 6.30 p.m. the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls, dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent to propose any motion and provided that, when no member rises to speak or at 8 a.m., whichever is earlier, the House shall adjourn until the next sitting day.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It seems to me that any debate with regard to Kosovo is meaningless and undemocratic unless there is a vote at the end of the debate.  
The Speaker:
That is a statement and not a point of order. 
Does the hon. government House leader have permission to put the motion?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice, during consideration of Government Order, Government Business No. 23, any speech by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition may be followed by a ten minute period for questions and comments and the House shall continue to sit after 6.30 p.m. this day for the purpose of considering the said Government Order, provided that, after 6.30 p.m. the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls, dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent to propose any motion and provided that, when no member rises to speak or at 8 a.m., whichever is earlier, the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day.  
This is done in an effort to get as many members of parliament as possible to speak to this important issue.  
And fewer than 25 members having risen: 
The Speaker:
Fewer than 25 members having risen, the motion is adopted.  
(Motion agreed to)

QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Speaker:
Is that agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
That this House take note of the continuing human tragedy in Kosovo and the government's determination to work with the international community in order to resolve the conflict and promote a just political settlement for Kosovo that leads to the safe return of the refugees.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in rising to begin this important debate I first want to pay tribute to members on all sides of the House who have shown resolve and leadership on this very difficult issue: the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose tireless commitment to resolving this crisis has taken him today to Brussels where he is representing our country at the NATO foreign ministers meeting; the Minister of National Defence who has led an impressive response on the part of our armed forces; the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration who moved her department the instant we received a request from the UNHCR to take in refugees driven from their homes in Kosovo; and the Minister for International Cooperation who has effectively directed her agency to take an international lead in delivering aid and support to the Kosovo refugees.  
I wish also to salute the opposition parties in the House. 
Their constructive approach and their non-partisan attitude have been important examples to Canadians.  
I look forward today to hearing the views and concerns of members on all sides of the House because whatever our individual views are about our involvement in Kosovo, we are each guided by our desire to do the right thing for Canada and for the international community.  
Indeed, like every other member of the House, like every other speaker who will participate in this debate, this occasion to address the House today fills me with absolutely no joy. 
Pride, yes, at the courage of the brave Canadian men and women in our armed forces who have entered into action with their comrades from the other NATO nations and who have put their own lives at risk so that thousands can be saved.  
Great warmth and deep, deep satisfaction too at the outpouring of generosity and community, of basic decency and humanity from the thousands and thousands of Canadians in every part of this great land who stepped forward to respond to the initial UNHCR appeal for help and haven for the refugees from Kosovo who have been so brutally driven from their land.  
Finally, anger and profound rage at the actions of President Milosevic and his regime who have caused this entire crisis, who are still leading a campaign of terror and destruction on innocent men, women and children in Kosovo and who care nothing about the costs or consequences to their own nation.  
These are the emotions we all feel, not just in the House but across Canada and around the world. 
This is a reflection of our values, the values that have built this country, the values that have made this a land of peace and opportunity, a land where we have made diversity not a tool for conflict but a means for a stronger, healthier way of life. 
These values must always guide our decisions at home and abroad.  
As elected officials, as those vested with great responsibility by the men and women of our country, we must always act in a manner that protects and promotes our interest as a nation. 
We must live up to our obligations as a world citizen, our obligations to the international commitments we make and our obligations to our allies.  
It is these three elements, our values as Canadians, our national interest in a stable and secure Europe and our obligations as a founding member of NATO, that led Canada to take arms with its NATO partners. 
It is because of our values, our national interest and our obligations that we must see the job concluded.  
By this time there can only be a very few people who still harbour any illusions about the regime of President Milosevic. 
For ten years now, he has presided over an unfolding tragedy in the very heart of Europe. 
It was in these conflicts that President Milosevic introduced the obscene new term of ``ethnic cleansing'' into the modern lexicon. 
In the last year, the same sickening pattern of violence against a targeted ethnic group has reached another crescendo in Kosovo.  
It was President Milosevic and his regime who tripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989. 
Who broke the agreements with moderate Kosovar leaders. 
Who violated their own commitments of last October to NATO and the OSCE. 
Who still ignore United Nations Security Council resolutions, including the obligation to bring indicted war criminals to justice before the international criminal court in the Hague.  
It was President Milosevic and his regime who began early last year to force Kosovars out of their homes. 
By the time the Rambouillet negotiations began, there were 260,000 internally displaced persons in Kosovo and Montenegro and 100,000 abroad. 
By the time the talks collapsed, there were 100,000 more. 
Now, there are a million or more displaced or exiled Kosovars.  
All this before NATO took action. 
All this part of an obvious plan, and a clear, proven pattern.  
The international community made every reasonable effort to find a diplomatic solution. 
Scores of diplomatic missions were sent to Belgrade. 
In October, an OSCE verification mission monitored a ceasefire in Kosovo, and worked on the ground to build confidence and solve local conflicts. 
The peace conference in Rambouillet was held. 
The Kosovars demonstrated courage by signing a compromise agreement. 
Only the Yugoslav President remained intransigent. 
Finally, Ambassador Holbrooke made the final appeals in Belgrade, face to face with Mr. Milosevic.  
It was only after all this that NATO was forced to resort to military action. 
Our goals now are what they were then. 
It is the commitment of NATO and it is the commitment of Canada as a member of NATO.  
It will not happen overnight. 
It will not happen without more loss of life in the region, including perhaps loss of life for NATO forces, but it must happen.  
It is important to understand that Canada is not acting alone. 
No one country can decide alone on operations or tactics. 
We are members of a team. 
We are contributing to a collective effort. 
And decisions are made collectively.  
Since its creation NATO has put into action the painful lesson we learned in two world wars, that peace and stability can only be assured through effective collective security. 
The continued campaign of terror waged by Belgrade is a threat to peace and security in the heart of Europe. 
It has already had serious effects throughout the region and it also threatens the many newly emerging democracies in the region.  
I do not need to explain which choice would have been more costly and more dangerous.  
Last week I had the honour of welcoming our first air crews home from Aviano. 
Their pride in what they are doing for Canada was obvious. 
And their skill and courage in dangerous skies is doing all of us proud. 
Come what may, I know that every member of this House will join me in saying that the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces who are delivering the force of our moral convictions deserve the support of all Canadians 100%, and they have it.  
I cannot close without talking about the one aspect of this crisis that has lifted our hearts and raised our spirits. 
The conflict in Kosovo is a depressing reminder of the past. 
But the generosity and concern that Canadians are showing for the Kosovar refugees is an uplifting reminder of what makes our contry so great.  
A week ago, the UNHCR asked Canada to help ease the growing refugee crisis by agreeing to take in Kosovar refugees. 
Toll-free telephone lines and faxes are being flooded with offers of help. 
Communities are opening their hearts and are eager to open their homes, in that typical Canadian way. 
And on behalf of this House, I want to thank everyone who is pitching in.  
If anyone ever wanted a description of what this country is all about, il they ever wondered why we have accomplished so much as a nation, they need only look at that tremendous, spontaneous reaction of people in every corner of this great land.  
As you know, the UNHCR decided on Friday to change its request and shelter the refugees in countries neighbouring Kosovo. 
Brave men and women who are working for non-government organizations and for organizations like the OSCE. 
They deserve our deep gratitude and thanks too. 
To be a bystander on Kosovo today would be to betray our basic values, our national interest and our international obligations.  
That is not how Canadians do things. 
We live up to our commitments and keep our word-all the way down the line.  
What is going on there has to stop. 
If we are to be divided by religion, colour, language and whatnot everywhere in the world, the world will not survive.  
We have an occasion to tell the government in Belgrade that this will stop. 
The homes of the people of Kosovo are there. 
They have the right to their freedom. 
They have the right to go to their homes and the Canadian people are with them.  
The Speaker:
There will now be a 10 minute question and answer period. 
I am going to limit the questions and the answers to one minute each.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has talked eloquently about the objective of ending the human tragedy in Kosovo and no one here disagrees with that goal. 
However, he had an opportunity today to ask for a mandate to pursue the military actions that are required to achieve that humanitarian objective.  
The way one asks for a mandate for military objectives is to spell out what those objectives are, the resources and the options available, any conditions that should be attached to the use of those resources, and then to seek a mandate from parliament through a vote.  
In 1991 the current Prime Minister attacked the government of the day for failing to hold a vote in parliament on advancing a decision to go war in the gulf. 
I am sure the Prime Minister would not want to repeat that mistake.  
Will the Prime Minister show some democratic leadership and agree, not today but in the immediate future, to bring a motion before the House seeking a specific mandate for the military objectives necessary to achieve that humanitarian goal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Everybody will be recorded. 
Somebody could just get up and say I agree and sit back.  
I am just sad that he wants to formalize it in a different way. 
I am open to looking into that, but I thought that giving the freedom to speak to everybody would be much better than just standing up and sitting down.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, since I have been sitting in the House, I have taken part in debates on Iraq, Kosovo and the Central African Republic.  
I have debated and I have spoken, but I have never voted on such an important decision as that involving the sending of Canadian troops, Canadian and Quebec soldiers, abroad.  
As we sometimes say in Quebec, I ask the Prime Minister to give me not one, not two, but three good reasons why Parliament should not vote on this matter if we are sending ground troops?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Mr. Speaker, we are not sending ground troops. 
I think we found a very practical formula, as I have just explained to the Leader of the Opposition.  
Rather than have a debate where only the leaders speak, followed by a recorded division, we decided to allow every member to speak. 
If the hon. member prefers to vote rather than speak, we will consider that. 
However, I thought that giving each member of Parliament the opportunity not only to vote but to say why they agree or disagree with the government was much more democratic than to hold a recorded division.  
If you prefer this arrangement, we will consider it. 
However, as a parliamentarian, I prefer that members have the opportunity to speak without restriction until morning. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, as one of the conditions for suspending bombing the UN secretary general and NATO spokesmen have outlined the requirement of an international force that could secure the safety of Kosovars in their own homeland. 
Yet the defence minister persists in referring to a NATO led force to secure the safety of Kosovars.  
The Prime Minister in his speech today very helpfully and wisely referred to an international force. 
Would he clarify whether the position of the government is as he has stated, that we are talking about an international force, or whether it is the position outlined by the defence minister, that is a NATO led force?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Mr. Speaker, I do not see a disagreement. 
At this moment the official position is that it should be a NATO force because there is a feeling that there is no possibility of something else.  
That is why I referred to an international group. 
I have written to President Yeltsin about my own view that the Russians should be involved. 
The Russians were involved in Rambouillet and I think they can play a role here.  
I would not personally object if the solution at the end of the day were something bigger than NATO, but so far as the position of NATO is concerned we say that it will be at the minimum a NATO force.  
I would prefer to have the Russians and others there because other countries might be interested in participating. 
Everybody in that part of the world is afraid the conflict will extend to neighbouring nations.  
Mr. André Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we often hear the Prime Minister talk about ethnic cleansing. 
It is now official, what is going on in Kosovo is genocide. 
We should no longer call it ethnic cleansing, but genocide.  
Often, the solution to genocide is war. 
In the Prime Minister's opinion, in view of the genocide taking place in Kosovo-his very own words-is Canada at war?  
My second question is this: by talking about genocide, is the Prime minister not backing international diplomacy into a corner? 
How can we sign a peace accord with a president and a regime the Prime Minister of Canada is accusing of crimes against humanity? 
Genocide is the worst crime against humanity.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Mr. Speaker, we are still talking about ethnic cleansing even though I used the other expression earlier. 
I should have said ethnic cleansing.  
International law and the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague want people involved in ethnic cleansing to be considered as criminals and brought before the tribunal. 
We want these people to stand trial before the tribunal in The Hague. 
President Milosevic will not allow anybody accused of ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity to be put on trial before an international court of justice.  
Last January, we deplored the fact that Madam Justice Arbour was refused entry to check allegations of ethnic cleansing. 
When there is a lot of ethnic cleansing, it becomes genocide-it is all a matter of terminology-and those responsible must face the consequences of their crimes against humanity.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what does the Prime Minister think the mandate of NATO is becoming?  
We went to Bosnia and became a police force. 
Now we are in Kosovo as a police force. 
It seems the original purpose of NATO was to be a defence mechanism. 
What does he see the future holding in terms of this new role for NATO?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Mr. Speaker, NATO is responsible for peace in member countries. 
The case of Kosovo, as it was with Bosnia, is very dangerous to the maintenance of peace in that part of the world.  
After that we sent some troops as peacekeepers. 
Our goal is to stop the ethnic cleansing going on today and to be in a position to send peacekeepers into that area so the people can live their normal lives in Kosovo.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This initiative is from the Bloc Quebecois.  
But what I want the Prime Minister to indicate is if he would be prepared, should Canada send ground troops, to let the House vote on the issue. 
This is what we want to know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
Mr. Speaker, this is a purely academic issue at this point.  
The suggestion that was made and supported by the Bloc Quebecois is to allow everyone to speak. 
We have agreed to give everyone a chance to speak, and now the Bloc Quebecois only wants members to vote.  
I said I would be prepared to consider that possibility, but it does not apply at this point, because we are not sending troops. 
There is absolutely no question- 
The Speaker:
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in preparing for this debate I asked myself what do Canadians want from their parliament and from their government with respect to the issue of Kosovo and the escalating violence in the Balkans.  
Of course they want parliament and they want the House, in the words of the motion, to take note of the continuing human tragedy in Kosovo. 
However Canadians want us to do much more than take note of the obvious. 
They want us to put partisanship aside and develop a united position on a situation involving issues of life and death, war and peace, and national and international security. 
What is it we hope to achieve politically and militarily? 
How do we expect to achieve it, in the air, on the ground and at the conference table?  
If we are agreed on the moral, political and military objectives of our involvement in the Balkans, I believe Canadians would also want parliament to give the government a clear mandate to pursue those objectives subject to any conditions which parliament may consider prudent.  
The Prime Minister's remarks have filled in a few of the gaps but they have done very little to fill in the gaps on the military objectives or how we will achieve them. 
It appears it will be up to other members to help clarify what Canada's objectives in the Balkans should be, what mandate we should give the government, particularly militarily, to pursue those objectives, and what conditions, if any, we should impose on that mandate.  
This I will now proceed to do on behalf of the official opposition and with the aid of my colleagues who will be speaking later.  
First, what is the ultimate reason, the moral objective of Canada's involvement in the Balkans? 
This is the one issue on which there is universal agreement. 
We say and most members here say that it is to halt the ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by the Yugoslav government in Kosovo and to care for the victims of Serb aggression. 
This is the moral objective. 
The importance and urgency of pursuing it cannot be overemphasized.  
Over the Easter break I had the opportunity to spend some precious time with our two little grandchildren aged 18 months and 9 months. 
These little lives, thank God, have not yet experienced any real pain or privation or violence or hatred. 
Those who love them will do everything in our power to make sure that they never experience those things.  
When we look at the Balkans and see the stream of refugees from Kosovo, now numbering in excess of half a million people, mothers, fathers, old people, children, babes in arms, victims or potential victims of ethnic cleansing, violence from military and paramilitary and police officials, children whose eyes have seen things that no human eye should ever see, children whose ears have heard things that no human ears should hear, I say that the moral imperative of a NATO presence and a Canadian presence in the Balkans becomes abundantly clear and it becomes imperative.  
In stressing this moral imperative, I am not ignoring the very real need to create a better legal framework for multinational action against inhuman acts by the government of a sovereign state. 
Nor am I denying the danger of developing and practising double standards with multinational groups acting against ethnic cleansing in one instance but declining to do so in others.  
As we know in the Balkans there is scarcely any ethnic group without blood on its hands. 
We acknowledge that the Serbs themselves have been victims as well as perpetrators of violence against ethnic minorities. 
At this point in time, with the magnitude of the humanitarian tragedy in Kosovo reaching the proportions that it has, I do not think we can allow these unresolved issues to stand in the way of concrete, collective action to halt the ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by the Yugoslav regime.  
Second, this debate should clarify what is the political objective of NATO's intervention in Kosovo and Canada's involvement in that intervention. 
What is the political solution that we would like to see achieved by negotiation rather than by clash of arms?  
Are NATO and the Canadian government still committed to the Rambouillet agreement calling for an autonomous Kosovo within Yugoslavia? 
Or is NATO and our government now inclining toward supporting an independent Kosovo? 
If so, would Kosovo be partitioned? 
Would a UN or NATO patrolled safe haven be established? 
What would be the wider implications of an independent Kosovo for stability and ethnic peace in the region?  
I believe that most members of this House support the notion that the answers to these questions are best provided not by our speculating on them, but through internationally supervised negotiations among the affected parties themselves. 
A clearer statement of NATO's and Canada's political objectives with respect to Kosovo, a clearer statement than that contained in the take note motion, would be to say we are determined to create a safe home for Kosovars in the region and to stabilize relations between the republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours through internationally supervised negotiations.  
Third, I turn to the area I felt the Prime Minister did not discuss thoroughly enough. 
What is the military objective that we are pursuing with our NATO allies through the current action against the Yugoslav regime? 
The motion before us is completely silent on this subject. 
Yet surely this is the issue on which the public has the most questions and one where we would expect the government to be seeking a more explicit mandate from this House.  
The Prime Minister has not elaborated on that subject today. 
In fact he has tried to avoid it. 
From the statements made by other NATO spokespersons, we conclude that the military objective of our involvement-and I think we should be precise about this; if we are misunderstanding it, let us get it corrected-is to damage the military capability of the Yugoslav government to thereby reduce its capacity to practise ethnic cleansing and to bring that government to the negotiating table. 
That is the whole purpose of the military operation in the Balkans.  
The official opposition supports this objective and Canada's participation with its NATO allies to achieve it. 
We support it as the regrettable means to a desirable end, namely to halt the ethnic cleansing and to force negotiations.  
As we have said before, we are supportive of the NATO air strikes and Canada's participation therein. 
We believe this effort should be given time to have the desired effect. 
We should not be stampeded into premature expectations by the video game mindset that governs the TV media coverage of such operations.  
It is also our view, as I wrote the Prime Minister on March 31, that once the decision was made to commit Canadian air forces to the NATO effort in Yugoslavia, we in this parliament should not engage in second guessing the mission when it has scarcely begun. 
Rather, we should offer our steadfast support, our political support, our moral support, our vocal support, to those brave Canadian personnel who are involved.  
I would hope that every member in this House would agree that achieving the military objective of damaging the military capability of the Yugoslav regime requires us to look ahead. 
Surely the expectation of the public is not that we just discuss the situation today-yes, we must discuss that-but to look ahead. 
What if something more than the NATO air strikes is required to achieve these objectives? 
Where does Canada stand? 
Where does the government and parliament stand?  
Speaking for the official opposition, we are prepared to support the commitment of Canadian ground forces to the NATO effort in Yugoslavia subject to two very important conditions. 
First, we are prepared to support that commitment if NATO can demonstrate that such a commitment is necessary to halt the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and provide a safe home for Kosovars in the region. 
In other words, if that is necessary to achieve the ultimate moral and political objective, we are prepared to consider it.  
If we are truly committed to the moral objective of halting these atrocities, we must not give the Milosevic regime any indication that our resolve is either limited or weak.  
The official opposition is therefore prepared to support the commitment of Canadian ground forces to the NATO effort in Yugoslavia if this is necessary, but also subject to the condition that the Canadian government demonstrate to the House that the commitments requested are within Canada's capability.  
The Minister of National Defence has repeatedly assured us that Canadian armed forces are adequately equipped to do the dangerous jobs they are called upon to do. 
But the government's foreign policy repeatedly expands our commitment to peacekeeping and peace making while its management of defence budgets has shrunk our defence resources from $12 billion per year to $9.3 billion.  
Our land forces have been especially neglected. 
Concerns with regard to Canadian land forces equipment have been raised by the auditor general as well as by many other experts. 
In some categories of equipment, Canada is at least a generation behind its NATO allies.  
If our Canadian forces are called upon to do a job in Kosovo or anywhere else, we must insist and do insist that they be given the tools to do the job. 
Hence the second condition, the need for hard questions about the adequacy of our resources and the need for straight answers.  
We believe that parliament should spell out clearly for the benefit of all Canadians the moral, political and military objectives of our involvement with NATO in Yugoslavia. 
If we are agreed on objectives, I also believe the government could then ask the House for an explicit mandate to pursue those objectives. 
Speaking for the official opposition, we would be prepared to give that mandate, provided that the military objectives were subject to the two conditions which I have outlined.  
In other words I am urging the government to follow up this take note debate with a more substantive motion along the lines of the following: 
That this House take note of the continuing human tragedy in Kosovo and the government's determination to work with the international community in order to: one, attain the moral objective of halting the ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by the Yugoslav government in Kosovo and caring for the victims of Serb aggression; two, achieve the political objective of creating a safe home for Kosovars in the region and stabilizing relations between the republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours through negotiation; three, pursue the military objectives of damaging the military capability of the Yugoslav government, to reduce its capacity to practise ethnic cleansing and to bring the Yugoslav government to the negotiating table; 
And that this House mandate the government to pursue this military objective through the commitment of Canadian forces to participation in NATO operations subject to the following conditions: (a) that NATO demonstrate that such commitments are necessary to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to provide a safe home for Kosovars on their own soil; and (b) that the government demonstrate to this House that the commitment of Canadian forces requested by NATO is within Canada's capabilities.  
That is the type of motion I would have liked to have seen and would expect to be brought by a government seeking a mandate of the House. 
To encourage the government to bring forward such a motion and to seek such a mandate, I move that the take note motion before the House be amended by simply adding the words: 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member spoke of a motion that would involve a vote in the House. 
During question period he proposed a vote that pertained to the deployment of ground troops. 
The Prime Minister, while not rejecting the possibility of a vote out of hand, did evade a direct reply.  
In my constituency office during the Croatian struggles and the Bosnian struggles I had all kinds of representations and anger on both sides. 
If the Prime Minister had said there would be a vote on ground troops, is it not true that every one of us would be subject to pressure and intimidation from both sides in our ridings?  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, on what important issue are we not subject to those kinds of pressures? 
That is part of the democratic process.  
Members from all parties today were not even asking for the form of the motion. 
They were just asking that if the commitment of ground troops is part of the possible future action in the Balkans that the Prime Minister would commit today to get a mandate from parliament through a vote before that action was taken.  
I do not think that is unreasonable. 
I think any representations on that issue by the public to ourselves would certainly be welcome, at least on this side of the House.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, in an article published by the Ottawa Citizen , the Reform Party critic for foreign affairs said, and I quote: 
``The Rambouillet formula may no longer be viable but sooner or later Mr. Milosevic will negotiate and negotiations are the only means of resolving this dispute''.  
My question is for the leader of the official opposition. 
Does the Reform Party maintain that position, or does it believe that ground troops should now be sent in, since Mr. Milosevic has shown that he does not want to negotiate peace for Kosovo?  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I suggest that the two options are not mutually exclusive. 
The point of the military intervention is to try to force the Yugoslav regime to that negotiating table which I think all members would prefer to be the forum in which this issue is resolved. 
The two issues fit together.  
We all wish that these people would come to the negotiating table without the persuasion of bombs and air attacks. 
That would be the hope of every member in this House. 
But if that will not happen, and it has not happened, then we say regretfully that we endorse the military action required to bring about the negotiations that members in the House would hope would bring a solution.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition a question with respect to the issue of the future and how the global community responds to a crisis of this nature.  
Obviously the current situation is critical. 
Many people are expressing deep concern about the possibility that somehow NATO is taking on to itself a new and very dangerous role of somehow being the enforcer of international humanitarian law. 
In fact this is a role that the United Nations, clearly needing some form of change in terms of its ability to respond, should be taking on and not NATO when we look at the tragedy in Turkey and the situation of the Kurds in Turkey, when we look at East Timor, Colombia, Sudan and elsewhere.  
I want to ask the Leader of the Official Opposition whether he agrees with the need for a new credible international mechanism strengthening the United Nations, getting around some of the paralysis that can result from the veto under the present structure. 
Does he agree with that need and with the need to look into what many see as the hypocrisy and the double standard that currently exists- 
The Speaker:
Order. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, I would agree that the current international legal framework for dealing with these crises is inadequate and that we should be working toward creating a better framework. 
I would not put all my eggs in the UN basket because, as the member knows, in this case the veto of action by the UN on the part of Russia and presumably China is enough to paralyze action.  
However, recognizing the need for this better international legal framework, I would still say that the inadequacy of that framework should not deter us from doing something in this particular situation. 
I think we should make it clear that we are not trying to generalize from this situation to every situation in the world. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. 
Some of the concerns which he has are shared by all members of the House.  
I was quite concerned that the Minister of National Defence evaded the question with respect to whether a commitment has already been made to NATO, if there are to be ground troops, that Canada is in.  
My question is for the Leader of the Opposition who has been calling for a vote in the House and who has proposed an amendment to the House. 
Could he explain why he failed to stand in the House to block the government's motion which prohibits a vote on this amendment, as we did earlier?  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, we want to have this debate, but more important, we are not insisting that there be a vote on this particular motion. 
It is a motherhood motion. 
We know what the vote would be without taking it. 
What we are asking for is a specific vote on a mandate for the government to take military action in the Balkans, particularly if that action involves the use of ground troops. 
Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his comments.  
Notwithstanding the tenor of question period which concerned ground troops, it is my understanding that the hon. Leader of the Opposition supports Canada's role in the air war, that he supports the air war conducted by NATO and its possible expansion. 
That is my understanding.  
The prime minister mentioned that he had written to the President of Russia. 
How important does the Leader of the Opposition think it is that Russia be involved in this situation?  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, again I do not want to presume to answer for other members, but I would expect that the majority of members in the House feel that the more that can be done to involve the Russian government and the Russian people in the resolution of this issue the better. 
The historic ties between the Serbs and the Russian government and the Russian people are deep and long. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party said that he absolutely wanted to have a vote in the House at the end of the present debate.  
He has a unique opportunity to decide what the House will do tomorrow. 
Why has he not introduced a motion which would have forced a vote on the government instead of just talking about it? 
This would have been more effective.  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, I have answered that question before.  
Our principal point, and perhaps I have to make it again because it did not sink in with some members, is that if the government is considering the use of ground troops or an expanded role for Canada in the Balkans it should come to the House with a votable motion seeking a mandate on which we will have a debate and a vote. 
This is not a vote of non-confidence in the government. 
Hopefully it would be a vote of confidence in whatever mandate is given the government and would be a help rather than a hindrance to solving this serious problem.  
The Speaker:
I find the amendment moved by the hon. member for Calgary Southwest to be in order.  
Before giving the floor to the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, I would point out that, as of now, speeches will be 20 minutes long and questions and comments, ten minutes.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With respect to your ruling, you indicated that the amendment put by the Leader of the Opposition is in order. 
Do we then take it that there will be a vote at the end of the debate on the amendment?  
The Speaker:
The direct answer to your question is no, there will not be a vote because it does not alter the original order which the House adopted today.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we will support the motion and the amendment even if I believe that neither truly addresses the need to find a short and long term political solution, which would not only guarantee the return of refugees to their homes but also respect for the rights of the Kosovar people.  
However, we deplore the lack of information provided to members, contrary to what was done during the campaign against Iraq in 1991. 
In that case, party leaders were consulted and invited to be part of the Canadian effort, in particular through regular briefing sessions. 
In this case, we got better information from RDI and CNN.  
To compensate for the flaws of the resolution and what appears to be an improvised government policy, I wish to make specific proposals, on behalf of my party, which should allow Canada to play a constructive role in ensuring peace and stability, not only in Kosovo but in all the Balkans.  
We are witnessing one of the most troubling human tragedies to occur since the end of the second world war, troubling because of the actions of the Serbian army and because the present situation is the direct result of President Milosevic's challenge to the international community.  
We have seen, in recent history, obvious instances of pure and simple aggression for the purpose of ethnic cleansing and territorial expansion. 
This was the case during the aggressions against the Kurdish and Tibetan people and during the tragedy which occurred in Rwanda. 
We did not learn all the lessons those tragedies and the first crisis in the Balkans should have thought us.  
Rather we are faced with a situation where a national minority, namely the Serbs in Kosovo, with the encouragement of the Serb majority in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, are trying to forcibly expel from Kosovo the Albanian majority, which represents 90% of the population.  
The Serb aggression is unacceptable. 
It is aimed at dispossessing the Kosovars of their belongings, their homes and their land. 
This aggression is all the more repugnant as it is also aimed at dispossessing the Kosovars of their past by erasing any sign of their historical presence in Kosovo. 
It is simply an attempt to rewrite history.  
At a time when human rights and territorial status quo have been recognized by virtually every country concerned, especially through the Helsinki accords, it is of paramount importance to find a political solution to this conflict.  
We would have liked the present crisis to be dealt with under the aegis of the United Nations as was the case when Iraq attacked Koweit. 
Unfortunately, close historical ties between Russia and Serbia and special political ties between Yugoslavia and China made it impossible.  
We were faced, therefore, with the choice of either standing by helplessly as the Kosovars were slowly stripped of their nation and territory by the Serbs or finding a way to counter Serbia's expansionism.  
Given the situation in Europe, following the failure of the mediation carried out by the contact group and the refusal by President Milosevic to ratify the Rambouillet agreements, NATO provided us with the only option available to put an end to the abuses committed by the Serbs in Kosovo.  
This is why the Bloc Quebecois supported NATO's strategy to use air operations to get the Yugoslav government to make concessions and supported Canada's participation in these air strikes.  
Unfortunately, no one had foreseen how brutal, swift and efficient the ethnic cleansing operation of the Serbian government would be in Kosovo. 
We are now facing a whole new situation that is forcing our allies to reassess their strategy in the Balkans.  
So, if need be, the Bloc Quebecois will support the dispatch of NATO ground troops to Kosovo. 
We will also support Canada's direct or indirect participation in a logistics force, for instance, in order to get President Milosevic to back down and to give up his policy for Kosovo that has turned him into a war criminal and possibly the instigator of genocide.  
However, parliament must be kept better informed of the military and diplomatic strategy of the government. 
The consent of members of parliament must be sought before Canadian troops take part in ground battles. 
Parliament must take position, members must be able to express their viewpoints and to vote on this issue. 
I have trouble understanding why the Prime Minister refuses to consult the House since he knows he can count on the support of all parties and that this support would reinforce Canada's position and strengthen the unity needed in such hard times.  
But before considering sending ground troops to Kosovo, before proceeding with this ultimate solution which would mean that NATO forces would engage in ground combat with Serbian forces, the Bloc Quebecois believes that a last effort should be made to resolve this crisis through the United Nations, which would have the advantage of involving Russia.  
In the meantime, there are two things Canada can do to alleviate the human misery created by this conflict and to prevent a ground attack, the cost of which could be high in terms of human lives, from becoming necessary.  
First of all, we must deploy all available resources to alleviate the suffering and improve living conditions of Kosovar refugees in Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. 
Therefore it is important to provide appropriate humanitarian aid and logistical support to the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.  
In this regard, I must indicate our support for the Office of the High Commissioner's decision not to play President Milosevic's game. 
Canada must certainly do everything it can in terms of humanitarian aid, including accepting, on a temporary basis, a certain number of refugees should it become necessary-and I insist on that point-or to allow people to be reunited with family members who already are in Canada.  
I say on a temporary basis because the aggression by the Serbs must stop and its effects must be reversed. 
This means that all refugees, wherever they are, must ultimately be free to go home safely, as soon as possible, to rebuild their life and their country.  
The contrary would be tantamount to supporting the policy of the fait accompli which President Milosevic has been trying to impose. 
We must not support that policy in any way, because it would only add to the human tragedy experienced by each refugee and would drive the Kosovar people to despair.  
I must also congratulate NATO for refusing to contemplate any partition of the territory of Kosovo, I must also congratulate NATO for refusing to contemplate any partition of the territory of Kosovo, for this would be tantamount to conceding victory to Milosevic and to rewarding aggression.  
Where territorial integrity is concerned, Kosovo must be treated in the same way Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia were. 
It must also be understood that Kosovo cannot be reintegrated with Yugoslavia as if nothing had happened.  
Since certain aspects of the Rambouillet accords were rendered obsolete by the obstinacy of President Milosevic, any solution to the current crisis must be based on the Kosovar people's right to self-determination.  
Given the variety of abuses and atrocities perpetrated by Serb troops and militiamen in Kosovo, it is unthinkable to again put the Albanian population at the mercy of the Serbian political power in Belgrade.  
In order to preserve some chance of avoiding a ground war, Canada must take advantage of all available opportunities, all international forums of which it is a member, to promote a peaceful and political solution to this conflict.  
To that end, the federal Yugoslav government must agree to bow to international will and to the five conditions presented by NATO if the air strikes are to come to an end.  
This means that Canada, via the UN, NATO and the OSCE, must take advantage of its diplomatic influence to encourage Yugoslavia to respect the rights of the Kosovo people, to put an end to its armed aggression, and to negotiate a definitive and political solution for the future of the Kosovars.  
If, despite the efforts of Canada as a member of the security council, the UN proved unable to find a rapid solution to the current conflict, it will have demonstrated that it is incapable of settling regional conflicts the way it is presently organized, and that a major reform of its institutions and its operations is required.  
Canada must become a proponent of such a reform, and use its security council seat to make that point.  
The conflicts in Rwanda, the Congo and Kosovo are just some of the most recent sad examples of the United Nations' inability to act.  
Second, the UN has also shown that, in the absence of such a reform, regional or interstate military organizations will likely increasingly themselves take whatever measures they deem necessary to ensure international security and to protect human rights.  
President Milosevic must be reminded that the world has changed since his glorious days as a communist apparatchik. 
As we enter the new era of international law, the despots, tyrants, terrorists and dictators are being forced to understand that they do not enjoy the immunity they thought they had.  
Furthermore, those responsible for crimes against humanity, torture or terrorism must understand that they will not escape justice.  
This is a new reality showing the change in international law, which three recent examples will amply illustrate.  
First, there is the creation of an international criminal tribunal for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. 
This tribunal has already handed down a number of decisions and is preparing to lay new charges against others responsible for war crimes and massacres.  
Second, there are the charges and the extradition proceedings against General Pinochet brought by Spain.  
Third, there is the trial in Holland, under Scottish law, of the Libyans charged in the terrorist destruction of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.  
Finally, beyond the tragedy currently unfolding in Kosovo, I would like to make a suggestion to put a stop to such drama in Europe, Africa or anywhere else in the world.  
As quickly as possible following the restitution of the individual and collective rights of the people of Kosovo, I suggest that Canada, together with other members of the Organization on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, promote an international conference on the status and rights of national minorities in Europe and the Balkans in particular.  
Based on the model of the conference in Helsinki in 1975, this conference, to which all the countries of Europe, Canada and the United States would be invited, would have specific objectives on the recognition of minority rights. 
At the centre of these objectives would be the issue of human rights, both individual and collective.  
These objectives could be formalized in a diplomatic agreement between signatory states, like the 1975 agreement or, ideally, through a treaty that would be more binding on the signatories. 
These countries would therefore enter into international obligations that would go beyond mere wishful thinking and guarantee the individual and collective rights of national minorities.  
That formula could also be used by countries from other continents, which could adjust their objectives and their means to the prevailing political culture, or to the values that produce a consensus.  
How can we achieve that? 
This could be done in two stages.  
First, in the short term, we must directly target the sources of instability in the Balkans, namely the difficult economic situation of the countries in that region, and the feeling of exclusion from major European political institutions.  
In this regard, we must recognize the wisdom of the position adopted last week by the foreign ministers of the European community. 
These countries have agreed to set up a fund of at least 250 million Euros to establish a security pact for the Balkans, similar to the Marshall plan.  
This fund for Balkan countries would be tied to partnership agreements with the European community, including on issues such as economic assistance and trade privileges.  
So, this is a step in the right direction. 
Following that, we will have to go further and to integrate interested Balkan countries into the European community and NATO. 
This is necessary to ensure Europe's stability, the region's prosperity and the security of Europe's economic and military partners.  
Second, we will have to convene the international conference on the status and rights of national minorities in Europe to which I alluded earlier.  
Since this is a long term effort, the preparations for such a conference must begin immediately after the end of the conflict in Kosovo, to ensure its success as early as possible.  
This is indeed an ambitious project, but the situation and the evolution of international law require us to be creative while pursuing lofty ideals.  
The Speaker:
Colleagues, we are going to limit the comments and questions to one minute and the answers to one minute.  
The hon. member for Toronto Centre-Rosedale.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on the fact that his party has aligned itself with the government position.  
When you admit that the cause is just and that force is necessary, when you are even prepared to go further than the government and now call for the commitment of ground troops, why do you put political conditions on your position today?  
You say that we do not have enough information, when we had all the necessary information in committee, when we are holding a debate in the House today that gives each of us an opportunity to discuss the issue. 
Why weaken our position, the position of the Parliament of Canada, with a condition that strikes me as completely political- 
The Speaker:
Dear colleagues, all questions must be put through the Chair. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Mr. Speaker, first of all, it is only natural that we discuss the politics of this issue, since it is a highly political issue.  
Second, there is a big difference between the information provided to members of the House in 1991 and what we are seeing now. 
I was critical of the fact that in 1991 we were in the process of voting when troops had already been sent to Iraq and we were watching the events on television. 
That was obviously one drawback.  
At this time, since we have already discussed air strikes in previous debates in the House, I am not questioning today's debate. 
However, the information provided in the briefing this morning was completely inadequate. 
We were asked if we had any questions.  
We should be briefed each morning, like we were in 1991. 
Back then, the Prime Minister invited all party leaders to become members of the Privy Council. 
Mrs. McLaughlin, who was then leader of the NDP, accepted the invitation. 
Right now, this information is not available. 
We go after it- 
The Speaker:
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The member for Richmond-Arthabaska for questions and comments.  
Mr. André Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I share the frustration felt by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois with regard to information and consultation.  
It is an extremely important issue. 
There is a lack of information. 
How can we be totally convinced of what is going on in Kosovo, in terms of the involvement of Canada and NATO? 
We cannot be convinced of anything because we do not have the necessary information.  
During the first week of the conflict, I received one phone call a day. 
I was asked if I had watched the news on CNN. 
That is where the information came from. 
During the second week, I received one call every two or three days. 
During the third week, I received one call every four days. 
It has now been six days since I last received a call.  
How can I keep my staff informed? 
How can my staff keep my constituents informed?  
If it was so important, why did the leader of the Bloc Quebecois not support our request to recall the House during the Easter break?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe:
Mr. Speaker, our discussions called for an emergency debate today, as was announced. 
Members of the Bloc Quebecois who sit on the foreign affairs committee, particularly the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry, followed all the committee meetings.  
Let us get back to the information issue, which I think is a major issue. 
We just came back here today, and so did our counterparts in Washington.  
There could have been follow-up throughout the entire week, had there been important information. 
I come back to my colleague, who earlier said ``You are weakening the position by asking questions''. 
I say to him that he is weakening the position by not providing information.  
Those who are informed provide better support than those who are not. 
There is a lesson in that. 
The government should inform us, ensure that we are always aware of what is going on and especially of military strategies-we are not naïve-and hold a vote. 
This would strengthen Canada's position. 
It is not those who are not doing anything that weaken it, but rather those who should be doing something.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Today, as we participate in this important debate on Kosovo in the safety of this House and in the security of this country, it still seems almost impossible to think of.  
They bring with them those few possessions they can carry and their anguish.  
Our television screens are lit as well by pictures of destruction from air strikes and bombs. 
Here too, innocent civilians are losing their homes, their neighbourhoods and their lives.  
Canadians who came to this country from both sides of the conflict watch the news and search the Internet for signs that their relatives are safe. 
In communities across Canada families and friends of our men and women of the armed forces watch and worry as the people they love risk their lives on dangerous military missions.  
Today our first and last thoughts must be with all of those people whose lives are touched by the tragic events in Kosovo. 
We are indebted to the service personnel who put their lives at risk and to the aid workers who are helping the refugees in Albania and Macedonia.  
While thousands of ethic Albanians flee from Kosovo, Canada with other NATO countries, is bombing Serbia. 
We are doing this to a country that has not waged war on Canada all without a resolution from the government, a debate on that resolution or a vote by the House of Commons, and without the sanction of the United Nations General Assembly.  
How did we get here? 
How did we get to this terrible place?  
For some years now, Yugoslav President Milosevic has been ruthlessly suppressing the rights of former states within Yugoslavia. 
By March of this year, as Mr. Milosevic spurned all attempts at peace talks, he amassed 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo and began a campaign of brutal ethnic cleansing. 
The United Nations Security Council failed to act.  
At this point all 19 NATO countries agreed to intervene with an air campaign intended to stop the atrocities of Milosevic's forces, push him to withdraw from Kosovo and accept the entry of an international military presence to protect civilians.  
For New Democrats the maintenance of peace has always been and remains our highest priority. 
Any decision to take military action is particularly troubling for us as internationalists seeking a peaceful world order based on respect for human rights.  
However, the scale of the human disaster unfolding before the world made it imperative in our view for the international community to act. 
To sit by and do nothing was simply not an option.  
As Tommy Douglas said about World War II: 
When a group of lawless men endeavour to destroy the fabric of law and order by which alone human society is possible, then I have a responsibility to discharge.  
Our actions are directed against the lawless violations of human rights on a massive scale in Kosovo, not against the people of Serbia. 
In this conflict, as in all wars, there is a tendency to demonize entire peoples and we must resist that. 
We must not forget the tragedy suffered by the Serbian people down through history and the threats which they face in the current catastrophe. 
At the same time we are determined to pursue those guilty of war crimes through the international criminal court.  
Not all Canadians support armed intervention. 
Some activists in the peace movement oppose Canadian intervention in the conflict because of their pacifist convictions or because of different interpretations of the nature of the crisis.  
My caucus colleagues and I understand and respect such views. 
We urge all members of the House to listen carefully and thoughtfully to them as we all struggle to determine the responsible course of action in line with our conscience and our convictions.  
Since NATO's air campaign began Canadians have watched events with anguish and dismay. 
We must now face the reality that the air campaign clearly did not stop the Milosevic atrocities in Kosovo as the NATO leadership led us to believe. 
In fact the brutal evacuation of Albanian Kosovars from their homeland has increased during the NATO strikes.  
The government's response has been to ask for patience, to wait and see if the military force alone will force Milosevic's hand.  
The government decided to focus only on military action. 
It decided to ignore political solutions and to forget Canada's internationalist tradition.  
Canadians do not want their government to be so mesmerized by military developments that it fails to explore every possible political or diplomatic opening that might end the bombing at the earliest possible opportunity and allow the Kosovar refugees to return home safely.  
Today we call on the Canadian government to take the full diplomatic action that Canadians expect of their government; to end the bombing at the earliest possible opportunity that gives the Kosovar refugees the chance to return safely home.  
We call on the government to initiate a diplomatic offer to the Milosevic government that if it will stop the ethnic cleansing, if it will stop the atrocities and the killing and agree to come to the negotiating table, then NATO will suspend its bombing.  
Since this crisis began there has not been a meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations. 
We also call on the Canadian government to call for a special meeting to address the crisis in Kosovo. 
We need to make every effort to build the capacity of the United Nations to act.  
Our first priority must be to seek out every diplomatic and political opportunity that could bring the bombing to an end at the earliest opportunity.  
The Milosevic regime may refuse all diplomatic and political overtures. 
The air campaign may fail to secure an agreement to allow an international force to accompany the Kosovar refugees back to their homes in safety.  
Should that be the case, the Canadian government and other members of the international community will no doubt explore what other means can be used to stop the ethnic cleansing, including the use of ground troops. 
In that instance, I and my New Democratic Party caucus colleagues insist that any decision to use ground troops must be made by members of this House only after a full debate and only on an explicit resolution presented by the government, with a vote to follow.  
Last week the Minister of National Defence sent out confusing and contradictory signals about the state of planning within NATO for the use of ground troops.  
If the government introduces a resolution on sending troops, the mission must be clear. 
The objectives of the air campaign were imprecise and not achieved. 
In fact, the humanitarian crisis was worsened as the result of the air strikes.  
Today we repeat our call for the government to seek international agreement for the force of ground troops that will accompany the Kosovar refugees back into Kosovo to be under some authority other than NATO. 
A force organized under the authority of the UN or of the OSCE might have some chance of gaining the acceptance of the Milosevic regime and bring us closer to a political settlement, especially if Russia were to be part of that force. 
Indeed, securing Russian participation in diplomatic efforts to resolve this crisis is essential.  
I am pleased that in debate this afternoon the Prime Minister indicated that he very much agreed with us in that regard. 
We are asking that the government play a more proactive role in advancing this position.  
While the scale of the refugee crisis in Kosovo surprised NATO planners, the generous response of the public to that crisis came as no surprise to Canadians. 
We were pleased that our government joined with other countries in offering to temporarily evacuate thousands of Kosovars to Canada should that have been necessary and desirable.  
On Friday, as we know, that plan was suspended after consultations with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. 
To remain steadfastly focused on the objective of Kosovars returning safely to their own homeland, we urge the government to continue working closely with the UNHCR. 
We hope and trust that the government will be dedicating all of the resources it was prepared to put into bringing refugees here to providing relief and support to refugees in Albania and Macedonia.  
As we grapple with the Kosovo catastrophe we must learn from it what needs to be accomplished internationally if we are to avoid such crises in the future or handle them in a more effective way.  
If governments did nothing about East Timor or the Kurds, the argument goes, if they stood by during the genocide in Rwanda, then they should do the same in this crisis.  
There is another reaction to this hypocrisy, a more hopeful one. 
This could be a major turning point, where governments that have in the past turned a blind eye to gross human rights violations are now prepared to take bold action to face up to them.  
If we are to make the legacy of the Kosovo tragedy a lasting and positive legacy, if we are to make this the beginning of a time when governments take their responsibilities for human rights seriously, then we have a lot of work to do. 
We must work to improve the capacity of the United Nations to deal with such situations.  
Lack of consensus on the security council prevented the UN from taking a lead role in this desperate crisis, but current political differences on the security council were only a part of the problem.  
The United Nations, like all of our current international organizations, is based on relations between sovereign states. 
Even though the UN charter refers to world citizenship, it has difficulties acting to protect the rights of world citizens where conflicts take place within sovereign states. 
This problem is one of the biggest challenges before the international community and we must deal with it in coming years.  
The absence of a role for the UN and OSCE in this crisis left NATO as the only organization capable of taking action. 
We cannot allow the particular events of this crisis to permit NATO to become the self-appointed policeman of the world. 
Since the end of the cold war NATO has been very much an alliance in search of a role. 
That role cannot, in the long term, be as a free agent operating outside of the authority of the United Nations.  
The crisis in Kosovo provides the latest proof of the terrible human cost of letting conflicts fester to the point where large scale military action is required to counter a humanitarian disaster.  
We have to work at finding new ways of resolving conflicts in a peaceful manner. 
I want to commend Project Ploughshares, Voices of Women and other peace organizations for their excellent work in this regard.  
Many potential civil conflicts could be prevented with progressive, enlightened policies of international economic assistance and co-operation. 
These policies will make civil strife and conflict more rather than less likely in the coming years.  
We know there is no quick fix solution to the Kosovo catastrophe. 
For the sake of all these world citizens it is imperative that we explore every possible avenue to resolve the conflict quickly and peaceably.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to explore with the hon. member what she would precisely propose in terms of this diplomatic initiative which she seems to feel we have failed to explore, given the background of the Rambouillet accord.  
The hon. member well knows, of course, that the OSCE operates on a consensus minus one basis and therefore no operation to the OSCE would have been possible without the agreement of Russia and many other countries. 
The UN was blocked through a Russian and a possible Chinese veto, as we know.  
What precisely does she say we should have done? 
Does she feel we should have done nothing and allowed the situation to develop recognizing the fact we needed troops? 
What has been said is we failed to pursue every diplomatic initiative. 
What else could we have concretely done? 
What would she have diplomatically pursued if she were in our place? 
How can she help the House?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough:
Mr. Speaker, I think the member knows very well that I did not make the assertions that he attributed to me. 
It is very important that we not be stuck back at the point of saying that the Rambouillet accord said thus and so and therefore nothing else is a possibility. 
It is very important that we recognize that we have been bombing for 19 straight days. 
The objective that was set out at the beginning and thought to be achievable within a few days has simply not come anywhere closer to being achieved.  
We absolutely have to redouble our efforts to seek every single possible avenue for a peaceful and early solution. 
How? 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, for all intents and purposes, Canada is at war. 
Canadian pilots are dropping bombs. 
People are being killed. 
Yet we have not taken a vote in the House of Commons in terms of a declaration of war. 
In any event as I understand it, the NDP supports the actions of the government so in effect supports this war that is taking place.  
The Leader of the Official Opposition has indicated that under certain conditions the official opposition would support the sending of ground troops into Kosovo. 
I ask the leader of the New Democratic Party, under what conditions would her party support, if at all, the sending of ground troops into Kosovo?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough:
Mr. Speaker, first I want to reiterate, because it is extremely important that we do so, that we have not exhausted all possibilities. 
We simply cannot take the position that only more military intervention is going to bring us to a peaceful solution. 
I want to carefully restate that.  
This was a question that was addressed by my colleagues the international affairs critic and defence critic on March 31. 
We took the position then calling for us to redouble our efforts to seek a diplomatic and political solution. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, since the leader of the New Democratic Party still believes a diplomatic solution is possible and desirable, can she indicate to us whether she believes the solution of autonomy is still possible within Yugoslavia, or whether what needs to be looked at, as I have just asked the Prime Minister, is a totally different status for Kosovo now, an international protectorate or protected zone, in light of recent events which make it very unlikely that Kosovars will want to co-exist with Serbs within their territory at this time?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough:
Mr. Speaker, in response to the question, we have to recognize that these are all options, that these are all matters that need to be fully explored. 
They can only be explored if we can get to the negotiating table. 
These are not options that can be considered in the context of relentless hostilities, aggression and bombing. 
We have to get to the table.  
It is absolutely critical for us to recognize that we have to move forward. 
If it is true that the bombings are achieving their desired objective, which is what NATO keeps claiming, then surely it is true that the situation is closer to one where the Milosevic regime will be brought to the negotiating table. 
We are simply saying that these and all options must be the subject of negotiation or we are not going to find a solution to the current Kosovo catastrophe.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
Mr. Speaker, some people have said it was impossible to negotiate with someone who had committed, or was presumed to have committed, crimes against humanity.  
What is the hon. member's response to those who think in this way and believe that no negotiation with Slobodan Milosevic is possible?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough:
If we are going to completely give up on the possibility that this can be achieved, then does the NATO bombing not constitute a hoax?  
The continuing stated purpose of the NATO initiatives has been to bring Milosevic to the negotiating table. 
That has to remain our objective, but it is quite clear through 19 days of bombing that has not been achieved. 
We have to try every single possible avenue to reach a negotiated and peaceful settlement. 
We will only be able to do that if we can keep taking bold initiatives that have some potential to put an end to the hostilities on both sides and get down to negotiations.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This discussion is overdue and a substantive debate and vote is what Canadians deserve.  
Members of the Canadian armed forces are taking part in a justified offensive action to end the slaughter and to return the basic rights of innocents in Kosovo. 
It is ironic that the Prime Minister and his government have had to be cajoled and shamed into consulting the elected representatives of Canadians with respect to Canada's participation in this conflict.  
Parliament has never been asked to vote on this terrible matter in Kosovo.  
War is not familiar to those of my generation. 
It is something I wanted to exist only in old film reels, yellowed newspapers and history books. 
Conflict in central Europe was something that was meant to be restricted to the archives or the annals of time. 
Sadly we find the atrocities of Kosovo dominating our mass media. 
We cannot ignore the lessons of history or shirk the Canadian tradition of service that we inherit.  
I offer my support and that of my party to the women and men of the Canadian armed forces. 
They are courageously putting their lives on the line to restore peace and stability to the province of Kosovo.  
Few of us here can properly appreciate or understand the commitment that our forces are making to end the terror of ethnic cleansing and racial murder in Yugoslavia. 
Our commitment to peace and safety of Canadians, our allies, the people of Kosovo demand that we cannot be neutral. 
Make no mistake about it, the Conservative Party supports Canada's NATO efforts thus far.  
We must continue all efforts to seek solutions that would ensure that our soldiers and the people of Kosovo have a dignified way out of this horror. 
However, we now confront the reality that Canadians are facing the real possibility of battlefield deployment. 
Now is the time to consult before more Canadians are asked to put their lives at risk. 
Canadians have a proud record of international military service. 
It is imperative that we exercise proper judgment and discretion when sending our armed forces abroad.  
It was a former Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, the leader of the Canadian government during the first world war, who said of a nation's military interventions ``continuous consultation leading to concerted action''. 
After all, it was Borden who during the great war worked tirelessly to ensure that Canada had significant military and diplomatic influence during that most infamous period of instability. 
Borden's efforts secured Canada a seat at the Versailles treaty table. 
His leadership helped define Canada's place on the world stage.  
This government could learn from Borden's actions and from the efforts of our former government. 
Through this conflict we have seen yet again the callous disregard this government has for parliament and the people of Canada.  
It appears Canadian forces were called to action without a proper plan. 
While we as a party fully support Canada's military actions thus far, it is the method and the means with which the government made this commitment which is offensive to parliament and to the Canadian democratic principles.  
The choices at times like this are never simple. 
Innocent people were being killed before the intervention, as they are now. 
With stakes this high, this real, it was incumbent upon NATO and Canada to act.  
Inaction can always be justified, and the world did justify it in Rwanda, in Burundi and elsewhere. 
This is a precedent of which we cannot be proud, either on humanitarian grounds or as for regional stability.  
Nor is this a precedent which should bind our hands in circumstances where the prospects of successful intervention might be stronger. 
There is a question of state sovereignty, but as Mr. Milosevic has demonstrated, there are a multitude of ways to violate the sovereignty of one's neighbours and one's people.  
At the end of the day the question became whether the alliance which had tried other means should simply stand back and let events take their murderous course. 
We cannot turn a blind eye when such inhumane suffering is inflicted on a people by their own government. 
History has demonstrated that it would have been preferable to act under the broader mandate of the United Nations. 
Canadians deserve to know in great detail how Canada used its unique influence as a member of the security council and as a close friend and ally of the United States of America to advance that option.  
In the early 1990s the previous government adopted a two track policy with respect to the crisis in the Persian Gulf, working for peace but preparing for hostilities if diplomacy failed. 
That record clearly shows that from the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, the former government engaged in extensive diplomatic efforts designed to find a peaceful solution to that crisis. 
Those efforts included wide consultation in that region and elsewhere, promotion of the importance of the UN as the instrument of the world's response, urging the prompt withdrawal by Iraq and counselling prudence on the part of our allies.  
Everything the previous government did, it did knowing that international peace and order was its overriding objective. 
And we did not fear consultation with parliament.  
The Prime Minister will recall that in 1990 and 1991 during the crisis in the gulf, the Progressive Conservative government placed before the House substantive motions for a vote. 
The Prime Minister has said in his remarks that our soldiers deserve the support and respect of Canadians and of parliament. 
Surely the best way to achieve that unanimity is through a vote in the House.  
The Deputy Prime Minister has put forward an amendment to a motion before the House seeking that the House of Commons give approval to the government prior to any commitment of ground troops. 
I ask rhetorically, will the Prime Minister seek such approval if the need for ground troops arises in this conflict? 
Our foreign policy should not shrink from the world around us.  
The crisis also raises questions about Canada's role and influence in international affairs. 
Sadly, under the Liberal government we are paying a price for the gradual deterioration in Canada's capacity to act internationally.  
This is what causes us to question the nature of its multilateral efforts in the context of the Kosovo conflict.  
We cannot forget that. 
Despite our huge investment in peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia, Canada was not invited to be a member of the contact group negotiating with the various sides of the conflict in 1995.  
In May 1995, when NATO bombed Bosnian Serb ammunition dumps in the vicinity of our peacekeepers, Canada was not advised of the situation in advance. 
Scores of Canadian soldiers were taken hostage in retaliation.  
On the other hand, the policy of the former government was to work with the United Nations from the beginning to take more action both diplomatically and militarily. 
We firmly proclaimed our belief in collective security and responsibility in our commitment to help others. 
It is a sad spectacle when the current Prime Minister admitted in June 1995 in this House that Canada's international stature was so diminished under his leadership that the UN and NATO gave us no forewarning of air strikes in Bosnia.  
A little over a year ago, the government was mounting the argument for Canadian participation in the military action against Iraq. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs at that time admitted that Canada had not made any serious effort to achieve a consensus among the UN security council before such action because we ran the risk of establishing and defining a rift within the UN security council.  
Pretending that problem did not exist was wrong and is highlighted today because that rift exists within the security council with respect to Kosovo.  
This is further evidence that Canada has not maintained the political and diplomatic capability which was until recently a defining feature of Canada's role in the world.  
It is still not clear, given the answers and the comments offered today by the Prime Minister, what diplomatic efforts the government undertook to resolve that rift.  
When my party formed the government of Canada, we were successful in bringing the unique influence of Canada to play in order to carry out one of the mandates of the United Nations. 
Has the present government really fulfilled its role in persuading Washington, Moscow and Beijing to carry out one of the mandates of the United Nations?  
How hard did the government try to use our unique position to persuade Washington, Moscow and then Beijing to achieve a UN mandate? 
Canadians have a right to know whether we mobilized our diplomatic and political influence with the same intensity in this case as we did so successfully in the gulf conflict.  
When military action is proposed certain standards of conduct and criteria must be met. 
First, there should be clear political agreement on objectives.  
Second, the scope of military action would have to be defined geographically and by capability. 
The government has deliberately chosen not to maintain the capability of the Canadian Armed Forces to live up to the roles we have traditionally played on the world stage.  
Third, military action would have to be appropriate to the circumstances.  
Fourth, the conditions that would precipitate a western military response would have to be clearly defined for all concerned in advance.  
Finally, due regard must be given to the disengagement scenario prior to deeper involvement.  
As for this last point, the Government of Canada must have known, when it agreed to air strikes against Serb targets, that ground troops could well be necessary if we are going to finish what it started. 
The use of ground troops is never a first option, yet perhaps a necessary one when the exercise of measured force is required.  
The Prime Minister and the government should have been more frank and truthful with Canadians at this time.  
Canadians and their elected representatives have been told that the objectives of the NATO operation are to halt the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, force the Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces returning to Kosovo to withdraw, enable the refugees to return home in safety and force the Yugoslavian government to accept the Rambouillet peace agreement along with the NATO peacekeeping force.  
Canadians are left with questions about NATO strategy: its short term objectives, its long term objectives and how its success will be measured. 
When will the NATO bombing campaign end? 
What is the criteria for any potential decision to employ ground troops? 
These are but a few of the many questions that need to be answered by the Prime Minister and the government.  
Recent reports from the BBC indicate that ground troops have been contemplated. 
A spokesman for the American state department suggested that NATO might put aside its reluctance to use ground troops in a military role in Kosovo. 
A spokesman for the minister of defence in London, General Sir Charles Guthrie, acknowledged that NATO planners had discussed sending in ground troops.  
He also suggested that even if Mr. Milosevic was ready to return to the negotiating table, he was uncertain whether that was still an option given the charges against him of crimes against humanity.  
This is the American view. 
What is the Canadian government's view on these important issues? 
Canadians deserve answers.  
The government refused to recall parliament while major decisions affecting the deployment of Canadian soldiers were being made. 
Where have we come as a nation and a parliament if we cannot set aside time to properly debate ideas for action to stem this crisis in Yugoslavia, a crisis that grips the entire world? 
We have taken this path before. 
Why can we not do it now when the lives of so many may be at stake?  
My final words and those of my party are for the Canadian and NATO personnel and their families and the people of Kosovo who are directly affected by this tragedy and this conflict. 
While we in Canada cannot fathom the depth of the courage of our military personnel or sufficiently comprehend the suffering of the Kosovars, we will work in unity to ensure that this conflict is brought to a just end. 
The efforts of our forces and the suffering of the people of Kosovo must not be in vain.  
It has been said that the history of the Balkans always repeats itself. 
Thus far these repetitions have been nothing but bloody and tragic. 
However, we must not assume that reconciliation in this region is still impossible. 
It is incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to make sure that Canada helps to end that chilling cycle of catastrophic unrest. 
The people of Kosovo must be free from tyranny and allowed to live in peace and freedom.  
There is an honourable heritage to uphold Canada's intervention and a moral obligation as a peace loving nation. 
The Conservative Party will support all legitimate efforts to seek enforcement of lasting peace in Kosovo.  
I would like to move an amendment to the amendment moved by the Reform Party that would read as follows: 
And in the interim, this House supports the existing commitment of Canada to the NATO action to resolve the continuing tragedy in Kosovo and requires the government to regularly consult and inform parliament respecting this commitment and any changes thereto.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The Chair will take the amendment to the amendment under advisement for a few moments.  
Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment and a question for the hon. member.  
I certainly remember being here on February 17, and we are debating it again today.  
I just want to set the hon. member's mind correct. 
I was a defence critic when the gulf war began. 
One morning Canadians woke up to hear that Canadian forces had been committed to the gulf war while parliament was in summer recess. 
The House was not recalled.  
He talks about a vote. 
Yes, there was a vote but considerably after the Canadian forces were committed. 
I remember that being a very major point. 
If my memory serves me correctly, the vote was on the UN resolution.  
If we were to make public that we will quit bombing in say 5, 10 or 15 days, does the hon. member think this would really help NATO or would it help Milosevic?  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I also recall that period of time, although I certainly was not a member of this House.  
What it did do was consult with parliament in a real way, in a debate that mattered and a debate that led to a vote.  
That is what members of this party and other members of the opposition have been calling for, a significant motion before the House that defines the action and allows parliamentarians to, at the very least, have their say and input, to have it considered by the government before it takes a position. 
I agree that the timeliness of the vote is important.  
Taking the hon. member's comments in their context, I hope this is an indication that the government is prepared to have a significant vote before any commitment is made to send ground troops into Kosovo.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity, in the presence of the Prime Minister, to state, as our Conservative colleagues found out this morning, that there is a problem with consultations.  
The government promised it would keep us informed, which it has not done properly, and should do better and more often in the coming weeks.  
The National Defence Act, for which the minister is responsible, provides that the Governor in Council may place the Canadian forces on active service in consequence of any action undertaken by Canada under the United Nations Charter or the North Atlantic Treaty and not requiring parliament's intervention.  
Is his party of the opinion that this provision should be amended so that every time we are considering sending troops- 
The Deputy Speaker:
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but the question is too long.  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my learned friend for the comment. 
I certainly do not hold myself out as an expert in international affairs, but I do take his point. 
It is certainly something that might be examined as to modifying the existing act.  
I want it to be very clear that we as opposition members are not asking asking to micromanage this intervention, this military action. 
We are asking for meaningful consultation and information that pertains to the serious questions that lead to the decisions the government is making.  
The Prime Minister has indicated that he will do more to advise the House and we take him at his word.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the arguments the hon. member has been making of late about the need for parliament to be able to give the government a more specific mandate in the context of an explicit motion and vote at some point in the future should perhaps the government come to the view that it wants to deploy ground troops, for instance. 
I would caution the hon. member not to hang his hat too firmly when it comes to this on the behaviour of the previous Conservative government. 
If my memory serves me right, we were well into the gulf war before we had the kind of thing the member is calling for. 
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
Sadly that will end at 6.30 p.m. and there will be very few in the House to hear the comments being put forward. 
There will be very little in the way of meaningful exchange. 
There will be very few ministers present. 
The Prime Minister will not be here. 
That is the objective we have been trying to achieve with the assistance of some members of the opposition.  
I can think of very few issues of greater importance that would lead the House not to have a debate, that would parallel the decision that must put our armed forces in harm's way in Kosovo. 
This is an instance where it should happen.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know it is not appropriate to comment on when people are in the House, but it is important to say that the Prime Minister is here listening to the debate because he does care. 
He is here right now in the Chamber.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, now that all five political parties have spoken, it appears clear to me that there is a consensus to send ground troops into Kosovo under certain conditions. 
I would rather the debate be about whether or not Canadians are prepared to send ground troops into Kosovo, period. 
Sending Canadian soldiers to fight a war in Kosovo means that the Prime Minister and parliament would be prepared to accept that Canadian soldiers will be killed in action in Kosovo.  
Before the Canadian government gets itself into a ground war, it should at least know how it will get itself out of a ground war in Kosovo. 
The Americans made the mistake in Vietnam of getting into a war they did not know how to get out of.  
Is the member from the Conservative Party not concerned that a precedent has been set as a result of what is happening in Kosovo, that in future whenever any internal conflict takes place anywhere in the world wherein ethnic cleansing, murder and rape are taking place NATO will be required under the precedent- 
The Deputy Speaker:
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I respect his opinion.  
It is not the position of the Conservative Party that we are at that inevitable point where ground troops will be sent in. 
However I take the hon. member's question as to whether a precedent has been set and whether we are concerned about that. 
Certainly we are concerned.  
I am afraid that there are instances in the world where conflicts are raging now and the UN or NATO has not intervened. 
Perhaps they should have. 
What happens, and it should happen, is that each individual conflict is examined and is given a great deal of thought before any military intervention takes place. 
I respectfully submit that is the way it should continue.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The Chair is prepared to rule on the admissibility of the proposed amendment. 
The Chair finds the amendment to the amendment to be in order and therefore the question is on the amendment to the amendment.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Speaker earlier ruled that the amendment which was put by the official opposition was in order. 
It seems somewhat strange that a take note resolution before the House that will not be voted on can be amended.  
I would simply ask for the authority under which amendments can be accepted to a matter before the House that will not be voted on.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am sure the hon. member is aware that virtually any motion, except I believe an adjournment motion, put to the House is amendable. 
There may be a few others that are listed in the standing orders that are not but there are not many.  
A motion, even on a take note debate, it seems to me is an amendable motion. 
It may be that the question is not put but that is in accordance with the rule adopted by the House in relation to this debate. 
Accordingly amendments are amendments. 
As long as they are relevant to the main motion and do not contradict the main motion and as long as they are not repugnant to it generally they are ruled to be in order.  
There is nothing offensive in the wording that has been proposed by the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough or by the Leader of the Opposition in his amendment. 
There is nothing contrary or repugnant to the main motion. 
They seek to amend it and clarify its terms. 
Accordingly the Chair has held them to be in order.  
I will not cite an authority without looking for the hon. member, but I am sure if he looks at his standing orders and at Beauchesne's he will discover there is plenty of authority for amendments to motions. 
Indeed it is common practice.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a further point of order in light of your comments. 
The Deputy Speaker:
No. There can only be a main motion, an amendment and a subamendment before the House at one time. 
Before another member could move a further amendment the subamendment would have to be disposed of.  
Mr. John Nunziata:
How do we dispose of it if we cannot vote?  
The Deputy Speaker:
You cannot. 
That is the short answer to your question.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
The grave events taking place in Kosovo have concerned the House for the last six months. 
The opposition has had every opportunity in a real way to contribute to the discussion and to the important decision making that has to be done. 
I find its complaints today to be absolutely groundless.  
For example, on four occasions since last October the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on defence have met either jointly or separately to discuss the Kosovo issue. 
In addition there has been a series of detailed technical briefings by military and other officials. 
Even during the break, even while members were across the country in other locations, the committees came together a few days into the air campaign. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for International Cooperation and I came before the committee to talk about Kosovo.  
Moreover, the House has debated the situation on two occasions prior to today in February. 
I looked at the notes. 
There was full participation and an understanding of what was at stake was discussed at that time.  
We still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, but everybody in the House knew the consequences last October if we did not get one. 
As a result of the threat of NATO air strikes, at that time Mr. Milosevic agreed with Richard Holbrooke of the United States, the special envoy, on a set of conditions by which we would then be able to prevent any kind of air strikes. 
However Mr. Milosevic, true to the form that we have seen in the past, did not live up to his word. 
He continually broke his promises.  
Over the months that followed an ever increasing level of violence against the Kosovars and the steadfast refusal of the Yugoslav delegation at Rambouillet to negotiate in good faith left us with very little choice but to resort to military force. 
Even then we took several months trying to bring about this diplomatic resolution, but diplomacy had run its course. 
We were in a race against time as the number of atrocities grew by the hour.  
The debate last October demonstrated that the policy of the government and the will of the House were one and the same. 
Our current actions in Kosovo reflect that consensus reached last October 7 in the House.  
I assure all Canadians that our objectives are clear. 
We seek the immediate end to violence in Kosovo; the complete withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees, a million of them; the stationing in Kosovo of an international military presence; and the establishment of a political framework under which the Kosovars can be appropriately governed. 
Those are the five conditions that were further endorsed today in the foreign ministers meeting in Brussels.  
The NATO air campaign is now in its 20th day. 
All hon. members are aware that Canada has now doubled its initial contribution of six CF-18s for a total of twelve. 
Some 220 personnel are stationed in Aviano: pilots, technicians and people in many other support roles, all doing excellent work for Canada. 
There are 100 people involved in the AWACS missions flying out of Germany.  
The decision to do all this was taken following close consultation with our NATO allies and careful consideration of how the air operation would be conducted.  
I can assure the House I have been in close contact with my NATO colleagues since the beginning of the crisis. 
Very recently I talked to my Italian and British counterparts, and on Saturday I met with Secretary Cohen in Whashington.  
Later this week I will be going to Brussels where I will meet with senior NATO officials. 
NATO's intensified air operations and Canada's additional commitment of aircraft are not signs that the campaign is failing to deliver results. 
NATO is engaged in a very deliberate and carefully planned air operation. 
The first phase of that operation was designed to degrade and neutralize Yugoslav's air defences. 
NATO has flown thousands of sorties, with only one aircraft loss.  
Mr. Milosevic is doing everything he can to hide his forces and allude NATO aircraft.  
Two conclusions should be drawn from these actions. 
First, our air campaign is having the intended effect. 
Second, we are reducing and weakening the capability of the Yugoslav forces to inflict their evil on the people of Kosovo.  
Outside of Kosovo, NATO forces are striking at vital Yugoslav military infrastructure and other assets that allow his army and police forces to operate. 
In the space of these 20 days we have destroyed 50% of Yugoslavia's fuel reserves and have reduced its capacity to refine the remaining oil. 
As each day passes the price that Mr. Milosevic is paying for his hideous actions in Kosovo is rising and his military capability is diminishing.  
This has always been our military objective and we are succeeding, but everyone must understand that it will take time to see this operation to its conclusion. 
A crisis of this dimension, a human catastrophe of this magnitude, cannot be solved in a few days or weeks. 
The important moments in human affairs are not for the impatient or for those with feeble convictions.  
In addition to our military contribution to NATO, the Canadian forces are taking an active part in addressing the humanitarian tragedy that has resulted from the gruesome actions of the Yugoslav government. 
We deployed two Hercules aircraft in Europe to help officials with the world food program to deliver much needed food supplies.  
This follows the delivery of blankets last week by CF aircraft. 
Canadian forces bases are available for refugees if that should prove necessary.  
The Canadian forces are playing an important role in NATO's military and humanitarian operations. 
They are facing the dangers and the challenges of a military operation.  
Let there be no doubt where this government stands. 
It is not only the Canadian forces' operation, it is the will of this Canadian government. 
As a nation Canada has always lived by certain international principles regarding peace, security and human rights. 
We stand by them as well.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister indicated to the House and to the Canadian public that there are approximately 700 Canadian troops from the west who are preparing, in some form, to be stationed in Kosovo.  
These questions beg to be asked. 
First, we would like to know what this government is actually doing. 
Can it tell us how it is preparing? 
What sorts of circumstances is it planning for? 
Is it readying itself for peacemaking, or is it just peacekeeping, or is it both? 
There is a difference between those two roles.  
We need to know about the equipment that Canadians will be taking with them. 
Do they have what they need to get the job done? 
Will they be protected to the greatest extent possible by the use of that equipment? 
What other plans would the military enact to ensure that protection?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to extend the time period for questioning the Minister of National Defence considering the important military component of this issue.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I do not know what the hon. member is proposing. 
How many minutes is he proposing to extend it by? 
Perhaps he could clarify that.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
An extra 15 minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
The Deputy Speaker:
Is it agreed to extend the time for an extra 15 minutes?  
Some hon. members:
Yes.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, this should be of no surprise to the hon. member because we discussed this in the House on February 17.  
This is relevant to the peacekeeping mission that was foreseen in the Rambouillet talks. 
We indicated at that time that between 600 and 800 personnel, approximately 700 if you will, would be deployed for that purpose. 
They would come from our base in Edmonton. 
They would be equipped with Coyote reconnaissance, one of the best, state of the art, armoured personnel carrier vehicles that we have, Griffon helicopters and other necessary equipment to carry out a peacekeeping mission.  
They are, as our troops are expected to be, fully combat capable. 
They are able to deal with a range of conditions. 
The kinds of conditions we are talking about for their deployment are the very ones we talked about in the House on February 17, and that is as a part of a peacekeeping mission.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment and a question for the Minister of National Defence.  
What the opposition objects to when we are dealing with such important issues is that the debate should be followed by a vote. 
I would like to hear the minister's view on this.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, we are grateful that there have been no casualties and no injuries. 
The military equipment being deployed is the CF-18 jet fighters, 12 of them. 
They are used frequently in carrying out the air campaign. 
They are well equipped. 
They have precision guided munitions that have been used extensively when the weather has permitted.  
I might add that that is an important factor. 
They do not want to release the munitions against the target unless they can verify the target visually because they want to ensure that they minimize any possibility of civilian casualties.  
They have been able to carry out their missions quite well. 
They are well equipped, well trained and they have carried out a stellar performance for Canada in this regard.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. minister if he could check and inform the House if the U.S. or any NATO partner is using A-10 Warthog jets with depleted uranium shells.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, I can only respond as I did when the question was asked during Oral Question Period today. 
I am not aware of any, but I would be pleased to inquire and advise the hon. member.  
Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I simply want to ask the minister if the House of Commons will be officially convened to vote on a formal commitment of Canadian ground troops, because I have the impression that our international role has been neglected in this whole scenario.  
I remember all the efforts made by the former Prime Minister- 
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, this has been talked about extensively today and in question period. 
The Prime Minister has appropriately answered the question with respect to a vote.  
However, let me say that if there were any substantive change in terms of our involvement in this matter, as I think it has been said time and time again, we would come back to the House for discussion.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the situation in Kosovo has a number of repercussions for Canada as a NATO member. 
One is the human tragedy of thousands of individuals so brutally forced out of their homes in Kosovo.  
I remind members that the refugees did not leave their homes voluntarily, and that most of them want to return. 
And we see their despair daily.  
As members know, Canada responded to UNHCR's appeal and set up the necessary infrastructure to take in 5,000 Kosovar refugees. 
This action was necessary because of the risks to which the refugees were exposed. 
Hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were forced to leave the region and all of them wanted to take refuge in neighbouring countries.  
This unprecedented wave of refugees massed at the borders represented a risk bordering on the unacceptable. 
These people had been forced out of their homes and had already endured great suffering. 
That is why Canada joined with other countries and undertook to offer these refugees a safe haven.  
Last Friday, the high commissioner, Mrs. Ogata, thanked those countries that had responded to UNHCR's appeal, but indicated to the international community that the planned program would be only an emergency solution to the problem of protection.  
Mrs. Ogata stated clearly the position of the organization she heads, and I quote: 
The majority of people should remain in the region to permit repatriation with security when the situation allows. 
Some individuals' resettlement would be appropriate to deal with special needs and family reunification.  
There will therefore be situations where individuals needing special protection in order to be reunited with their families will have to be resettled in third countries, this time on a permanent basis. 
Decisions will be taken with the co-operation of international organizations specialized in this sort of intervention.  
Canada's legislation makes provision for such situations. 
Already, our staff are in the region, ready to accept applications. 
This aid is beginning in the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia, with our international partners, and is continuing in Canada, with our local partners.  
The situation in Kosovo remains volatile, but it has now evolved to the point where the refugees can remain in the area in relative security. 
Many members heard our ambassador, Raphael Girard, tell Canadians yesterday about the satisfactory conditions in five of the six main refugee camps in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  
Conditions in those camps are improving to the extent that Canadian purchased toys have been distributed to some children. 
Food, water and health supplies are arriving in part through the efforts of the men and women of the Canadian forces and Canadian NGOs. 
Shelters are being constructed and these refugees have the level of protection that was fundamental to the decision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  
The situation, I repeat, is in constant evolution. 
Canada will continue preparations and maintain a state of alert should the situation change in the days and weeks to come. 
In the event the UNHCR decides to proceed with an emergency evacuation we are ready. 
Canada has a proud humanitarian tradition. 
Canadians are compassionate people who have historically come to the aid of those in need.  
In addition to the UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration, the IOM, would play a key role in the registration and transportation of the refugees to Canada. 
Canada's capacity to respond to a major evacuation would be intimately tied to the structures that the UNHCR and the IOM are putting in place on the ground. 
I have every confidence that these organizations will succeed in their task.  
Our partners at the Red Cross would play a critical role in any operation we might undertake. 
We must remember that many of these people are travelling from camps in which the Red Cross symbol appears on tents, trucks and food parcels. 
This recognizable symbol would be highly visible in the reception centres in Canada.  
The Red Cross could also make its family messaging services available shortly to refugees through its international network. 
Red Cross officials assure me that they are ready to extend humanitarian services and that their personnel are standing at the ready. 
I am pleased to have the assistance of the Red Cross with its expertise in helping refugees from affected countries in Europe.  
Our partnerships at various levels have been the key to success in this initiative. 
While the operation is led essentially by the Canadian government, the provinces have a crucial role to play, as is the case with many aspects of our refugee protection program.  
We have daily contacts with provincial officials to solve issues of mutual interest and co-operation. 
I want to thank our provincial partners for their co-operation and for opening their doors to refugees.  
I also want to thank the people in the communities around the military facilities that we are planning to use. 
They too have worked together and prepared to welcome refugees.  
We are also continuing to work closely with NGOs whose expertise in the management of humanitarian crises is precious. 
Employees from my department have worked closely with employees from other federal departments who have shown dedication and flexibility in meeting the particular needs of refugees, while striving to improve the overall situation in Kosovo, and I want to thank them for that today.  
I would be remiss if I did not mention the extraordinary generosity of Canadians, as our Prime Minister did earlier today. 
The toll-free line that we set up last week was flooded with calls. 
The offers of assistance that have been coming in steadily through this line since last Wednesday are simply extraordinary.  
We have received more than 7,000 calls and 1,000 faxes. 
The assistance offered ranges from the large bedroom that the eldest daughter in a family is willing to make available to a family of refugees so they can sleep together to the free English lessons that a university student is willing to give.  
This confirms my conviction that Canadians are compassionate people who are always willing to help those in need. 
Therefore, I want to thank all Canadians who have offered to help in so many different ways the refugees from Kosovo. 
We are sure that Canadians would open their arms and their hearts to make the refugees from Kosovo feel welcome in our country.  
Canada is a caring society. 
Compassion is a strong element of our national character. 
The situation is changing very quickly and could change again over the next few days, but I know that whatever happens in the coming days and weeks we have already witnessed a demonstration of Canada's humanitarian tradition in action within our home borders and in our homes.  
I am satisfied that the Government of Canada and its many partners are ready to move quickly and effectively should the UNHCR renew its request to offer a safe haven to a large number of refugees. 
Furthermore, the UNHCR knows we are also ready to assist in individual cases of refugees who need protection in Canada. 
Our efforts are entirely consistent with the larger international effort in responding to the needs of refugees. 
As a Canadian I am proud that assistance has been offered to these people.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps we could get unanimous consent to question the minister longer than just the five minutes allotted. 
Perhaps it could be extended to 10 minutes.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments by 10 minutes?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Some hon. members:
No. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister made an extremely important point in her speech that Canadians truly are very generous. 
They have offered to open their homes and their lives to refugees. 
That shows a generosity that is quite amazing in fact. 
It has left a very positive impression on me.  
I have a couple of questions for the minister. 
What process will be put in place to ensure that any refugees we choose will go through the proper security checks? 
There is some concern in that regard.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard:
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the fear the Reform Party has of criminals all the time. 
We are speaking about people in need who were forced to leave their homes and their country. 
We are here to speak about the help we can give them.  
It is clear that we will act in co-operation with the UNHCR. 
We have always done so in the past. 
When there is an international crisis we work with the UNHCR. 
It is the expert in the field. 
UNHCR will refer these people to our immigration officers and of course we will do some medical and security screening.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here is my question for the minister.  
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are over 655,000 refugees abroad, but within Kosovo itself there are 800,000 displaced persons.  
To your knowledge, are Canada and other countries able to help displaced persons inside Kosovo and is it enough to help refugees outside Kosovo?  
When will we know whether the High Commissioner for Refugees will ask Canada to take in some refugees and how exactly do you intend to inform the population?  
The Deputy Speaker:
I ask the hon. member to address his comments to the Chair. 
The hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard:
Mr. Speaker, we are certainly concerned also by the situation of those inside Kosovo. 
As far as the time frame to bring people here is concerned, we already have two immigration officials in the field. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to speak about some of the comments that were made earlier by the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough. 
I know that he and the Prime Minister are both students of history. 
He was referring to Robert Borden's comments that we must ensure parliament always has continuous and meaningful consultation.  
As was asked by the member for Compton-Stanstead earlier in question period, has the Government of Canada made a commitment to NATO to send in ground troops? 
That question was asked of the Minister of National Defence but he did not answer it. 
Does she have any knowledge that commitment has been made by any member of cabinet or by the Minister of National Defence?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard:
Mr. Speaker, I realize the question is for either the Prime Minister or the national defense minister, but I understand both my colleagues emphatically answered no to the question.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it certainly is my pleasure to address the question of Canada's involvement in the crisis in and around Kosovo.  
We have heard from the leader of the Reform Party that the official opposition is strongly supportive of Canada playing a role in bringing this humanitarian crisis to an end. 
Reform wants to see a rapid end to Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing. 
We want to bring stability to this troubled region as quickly as possible and as peacefully as possible.  
Let me be clear. 
We stand united with NATO. 
We will not tolerate Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing and we are prepared to crush his military until he stops.  
Canada has several responsibilities in this crisis. 
We have responsibility to the innocent Kosovar Albanians who are being driven from their homes, forced out of their country, stripped of their identity and in many cases killed simply because of their ethnicity. 
Canadians will not tolerate that.  
In the past couple of days two polls have shown that a majority of Canadians want NATO and Canada to take decisive military action against Milosevic. 
Canada also has a responsibility to our NATO allies. 
We must stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies to demonstrate to Milosevic our resolve to end his hostilities against Kosovar Albanians. 
Canada also has an historic responsibility to restore peace through diplomatic means. 
We stress that attempts to bring a diplomatic end to this crisis should continue in spite of the ongoing military action.  
We also have a responsibility to our troops and their families. 
We must ensure that any decision to engage Canadian forces has been carefully thought through as a clear definition of Canada's role and has a well defined goal.  
I do not believe the motion we are debating has a clear defined goal when it comes to any involvement of the military. 
The use of ground forces is a very real possibility and Canadians deserve to know that parliament has had a full debate on this question. 
The government has a responsibility to put all the facts on the table. 
The official opposition will continue to press the government on this point, as it will on the need for a vote should the issue become more paramount in the very near future.  
Canadians should be proud of their troops. 
They have been carrying out a very difficult mission in Yugoslavia, far more in the last two weeks than previously. 
They have shown a tremendous degree of professionalism and confidence. 
On behalf of the official opposition I congratulate them on a job well done.  
Since the first hints of NATO military action surfaced I have been in favour of Canada lending its support to the efforts to bring Milosevic's military to its knees.  
Now, after several months of continued atrocities against ethnic Albanians, the need for more military action is even more clear. 
However, the massive refugee problem has likely changed the measures we need to take to ensure stability in the region. 
NATO military planners originally thought air strikes would be sufficient to bring Milosevic to heel. 
Ground troops would then have gone in only after a peace agreement was reached.  
While it is too early to tell, it looks as though ground forces may be necessary before a peace agreement is reached in order to ensure the resettlement of over 500,000 ethnic Albanians who have been driven out of Kosovo. 
I stress that I think it is still too early to tell whether such action will be necessary. 
I also want to point out that it is up to NATO to determine what the military action would be at that point. 
That being said, we as members of parliament have a duty to discuss the possibility of a Canadian military contingent being sent to Yugoslavia as part of a NATO ground force.  
As I said earlier, our position is clear on this. 
We will support NATO's decision to send in ground troops if they determine that is what is necessary to achieve our common objectives, that is, the resettlement of Kosovar refugees and an end to ethnic cleansing.  
We called for this debate for two reasons. 
First, we believe parliament should be consulted before Canada participates in any escalation of NATO military action in Yugoslavia. 
There are a number of obvious questions raised by this crisis that need answers. 
Given the refugee problem has increased exponentially, the military mission may have changed or may be about to change and the objectives of this government may be changing to a degree. 
We want to know that.  
We would like to know if this has changed the government's goals. 
Has the government changed its objectives since the beginning of the campaign? 
Furthermore, how far is the government willing to go to achieve its objective, that is the resettlement of Kosovar Albanians?  
Are there projected timelines for Canadian participation? 
Are there anticipated roles for our troops? 
Will they fulfil reconnaissance, engineering, supply, medical, or combat roles? 
What specific preparations are our troops undergoing in anticipation of joining a possible NATO ground force both before and after a peace agreement is reached?  
These questions beg to be answered. 
In spite of the fact that there is no commitment, it is incumbent upon government to be able to deal with questions such as those being presented here.  
Are our troops outfitted with the equipment they need to do the job? 
I know there is always a role for Canadian troops in any theatre, but the more dangerous the situation is, the more high intensity of the combat area, the greater the needs of any military troops entering that field. 
What kind of equipment will our troops have when they walk right into that conflict, if they ever do walk into that conflict on the ground?  
The auditor general has expressed concerns about Griffon helicopters, Coyote reconnaissance vehicles and other Canadian military equipment. 
Have these concerns been addressed?  
Sending equipment and troops into this conflict also raises important questions about the new role of NATO and its role in protecting international stability but I feel these would be more appropriately raised at another time. 
Some of these questions would include an examination of the causes of Canada's diminishing role in international military decision making, an examination of NATO's changing role as an international police force and an examination of the command and control structure of NATO and how Canada fits into this framework. 
In the meantime, I want to stress that as a demonstration of our support for Canada's commitment to NATO allies, Reform remains committed to the present NATO course of action.  
Let me elaborate on some of my earlier questions for the government. 
Has the government changed its objective in pursuing military action in Kosovo? 
Ending ethnic cleansing and resettling refugees are my main reasons for supporting NATO action. 
Has the government's role changed? 
I need to know from the government that we are on the same wavelength on this issue. 
Does the government have other plans? 
Does the foreign affairs minister have another agenda? 
Does he want to take military action a step further and try to establish a new independent Kosovar state?  
We should know these things before more Canadian troops are committed. 
What are the expected time lines? 
Does the government have any idea how long Canadians will be committed? 
Does it expect that it will be a short engagement, say a few months, or is this something that could escalate into a timeframe of a decade?  
All of this depends on the government's goals. 
Does the government have a particular role in mind for our troops? 
Will our troops be forming front line combat roles, or will they fulfil other important functions, for example in communications, supply, engineering or medicine? 
I previously put a question to the minister after his presentation. 
We do know that around 700 Canadian troops in the west are preparing for engagement in Kosovo. 
We need to know about the equipment the Canadians will be taking with them. 
I understand there are some Griffon helicopters. 
Do they have what they need to get the job done? 
Will they be protected to the greatest extent possible?  
The men and women of the Canadian forces are well trained. 
They are brave beyond words. 
I have talked to many international soldiers in that regard about some of the circumstances under which they have served and which those of even greater military might may not have even ventured into. 
They are very professional. 
I want to be assured that the government knows what it is doing.  
My sense is that for the time being at least we are all pretty much on the same wavelength. 
I would be surprised if there is a great gulf between the government and the opposition so far on this issue.  
I ask these questions because it is crucial that we all spell out precisely what we have in mind before we get into the crisis any further. 
It is only fair not only for the opposition but for the Canadian public as well as the military. 
History has shown that the threat of massive military action has frequently been the very thing that brings aggressors to the bargaining table. 
I think we all hope that this will be a similar case.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This is a unique experience, Mr. Speaker. 
I get to ask the defence critic a question.  
I first want to preface my remarks by saying that I do very much appreciate the praise he gave to our troops, the support for the NATO action and for the action of this government in support of NATO.  
I want to also assure him that there are no commitments. 
He was concerned that there might be commitments beyond those that have been publicly announced or those that have been discussed in the House. 
I can assure him that is not the case.  
With respect to how long this might take, we are into a situation where it is not a question of end date, it is a question of end stage. 
It is a question of being able to achieve the successful return of the Kosovars and a peaceful and secure atmosphere in Kosovo.  
I want to ask the member a question. 
After all, if our NATO allies do not think there should be any change, then obviously Canada would not be out of step with its NATO allies, would it?  
Mr. Art Hanger:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his questions.  
I certainly agree that is the place to start. 
If the minister recalls throughout my entire presentation, I alluded to that point time and time again.  
The debate on this topic is an issue that involves more than just a commitment of ground troops. 
That was our point right from the beginning.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two quick questions.  
The second question I have for the hon. member is assuming that Canada does commit ground troops, which I think would be sheer madness, what would the exit strategy be? 
Americans went into southeast Asia, into Vietnam, thinking it would be of short duration. 
Some 15 or 20 years later, they surrendered after 65,000 Americans were killed.  
Mr. Art Hanger:
Mr. Speaker, the member speaks of an exit strategy. 
That is a major concern for me.  
If the member wants to compare it to Vietnam, he can of course see that the height of political interference into a commitment made by their country impacting directly on the military. 
The military could not do the job it was assigned to do because of the very political interference that we hope to avoid here. 
If the military is assigned to do a job, it should be given a certain amount of freedom to accomplish that particular job and make sure that it is done effectively.  
For Canadian troops to enter into some sort of a zone where there is a threat to them, unfortunately we do not have the capability of extraction. 
We have to rely very much on the presence of our allies to do that. 
I would suggest that there would be a need for a lot of support by our allies to put Canada in a role that would be most suitable for them.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member had to say. 
We know he has the interests of the armed forces very much at heart.  
With regard to his emphasis on a vote on some or other fairly hypothetical aspect of this exercise, I wonder if he would give us some thoughts about that. 
It seems to me that we are engaged in an exercise that has been going on now for some years in which we are increasingly putting pressure on Mr. Milosevic with a view to getting him to back down and to allow the people of Kosovo to go home. 
The military side is partly threats and partly some of the reality which we are facing now. 
Does the member seriously think that to commit ourselves well in advance on a hypothetical question affects the effectiveness of the strategy that we are engaged in?  
Mr. Art Hanger:
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing hypothetical about the democratic process. 
We in the Reform Party simply put it to the government that if the issue of committing troops comes up a vote be taken in the House. 
What will that do? 
It will substantiate in the minds of the Canadian public and politicians, as well as of our troops, that parliament is behind them. 
There is nothing hypothetical about that. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the defence critic for the official opposition, said that he would support the actions of NATO, and the minister also suggested should it not be enough that NATO supports this action.  
When the member says it is important for Canada to follow the lead of NATO, is it not equally important that Canada be involved in the process within NATO? 
We have no real indication that Canada was intimately involved in making this decision in the first place.  
Mr. Art Hanger:
Mr. Speaker, Canada's commitment to NATO goes back many decades and we have certainly had our periods of greater influence in that organization.  
Unfortunately we are not always at the military negotiating table as we should be.  
We have the opportunity, as a country, to be more influential, but there have been philosophical changes in the way this government looks at our military and its influence in the world. 
In fact, it is an influential entity. 
There is much more that we could offer and I would suggest that diminishes our influence within the NATO circles.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, does the Reform member believe NATO should play a humanitarian role, as it is doing now, since in this conflict its role has obviously been not only to deliver air strikes, but also humanitarian aid to refugees in countries next to Kosovo?  
Mr. Art Hanger:
Mr. Speaker, the member asked whether I think NATO should be involved in a humanitarian role. 
I believe that whether it be military action or specific assistance, such as aiding in the distribution of food and other humanitarian actions, both should fit into the role of NATO. 
One cannot be done without the other in many respects. 
If it means having to move certain kinds of aid through a war torn area or to a war torn area, NATO has the power to assist, to protect and even to help distribute supplies. 
It certainly would have the power, as far as the military entity is concerned, to protect refugees who have no means of protecting themselves.  
Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as Minister for International Cooperation I want to give the House an update on the measures taken by Canada through the Canadian International Development Agency to provide humanitarian assistance to the desperate people fleeing Kosovo.  
Two weeks ago on March 30 we approved $10 million in humanitarian assistance for Kosovar refugees. 
We wasted no time to put it to work. 
Within 24 hours a $2.5 million cash contribution was on its way to the UNHCR. 
Last week on April 7 I approved $5 million in food aid. 
This $5 million will cover both the purchase of Canadian and other food supplies and the cost of shipping them in and around the region on national defence and commercial flights. 
In a few days a shipment of Canadian fish will be sent to the area. 
This is part of our response to requests by the World Food Programme. 
Just over $3 million had been provided in the past year for humanitarian assistance. 
Another $3.85 million was provided for the Kosovo verification mission carried out by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. 
Some members of the verification mission are now supporting humanitarian efforts. 
For example, civilian observers are helping to register refugees in the camps.  
To date we have committed $22 million to the crisis in Kosovo. 
We continue to monitor the situation to see how we can further respond to the current crisis and how we can contribute to reconstruction and peacebuilding efforts in the future.  
I was remiss when I began my remarks. 
I meant to say that I will be splitting my time with one of my colleagues.  
As we all know, the refugees' situation has reached tragic proportions. 
By the accounts of executions and torture. 
And we think of the children who have witnessed scenes of unbearable violence.  
We are there to help with their immediate needs, but we do not forget that they will need more services-such as psychological counselling-to get over this ordeal in the long run. 
We are already in touch with UNICEF, whose work we have supported for the children of Bosnia.  
Faced with a humanitarian disaster of such magnitude, Canada is stepping in to give some hope to these people, who have been taken away from their home, their job, their family and their whole life. 
In all this show of solidarity, let us not forget the compassion shown by the people of neighbouring countries, those who are welcoming so many refugees into their homes no matter what their situation is.  
No one would have thought, not so long ago, that they would have been drawn into such an abberation. 
These refugees can count on our compassion and our humanitarian assistance. 
As we respond to the alarming situation of the thousands streaming across the borders, let us not forget those who have not made it across, those who are still in Kosovo and in Serbia.  
I am particularly concerned by the information we are getting about their situation. 
It is impossible to obtain accurate information, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not yet gained access.  
I call on all those involved directly or indirectly to help the International Red Cross provide assistance to affected communities.  
Right now, information is sketchy and sometimes contradictory. 
We are hearing about thousands of people trapped in the mountains. 
We are also hearing about Serbs fleeing Kosovo and going into Serbia and Montenegro. 
We are even hearing about massacres, although we are unable to verify this. 
Part of the funds I announced will serve to answer the appeal by the International Red Cross.  
To date, Canada has provided $22 million. 
We are obviously following developments closely and are prepared to do more. 
Eventually, we will also contribute to peacebuilding and reconstruction efforts in the region.  
And let us not forget the generosity shown by Canadians. 
Calls are pouring in from Canadians responding to requests to help these refugees going through an unbearable ordeal. 
I want to extend my warmest thanks to them, here, today.  
We are proud to do our part in what must be an international effort. 
Canada is one player. 
Let me point out that our approach is true to our commitment to working not only one on one in bilateral settings, but also as a team player in multilateral settings.  
In this case we are making sure that our contribution has the maximum impact by working closely with the people and organizations already in the field. 
These organizations, such as the UNHCR and the World Food Programme, are closest to the needs of the refugees. 
They have been monitoring the situation and providing assistance in difficult circumstances; not just in the last few weeks, but for months, from the onset of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign. 
These organizations have our full support and admiration for the work they have done in appalling conditions.  
Team work is also crucial within Canada. 
Immediately after announcing our humanitarian assistance package I met with Canadian NGOs to ensure that Canada's efforts made the best possible use of their readiness and experience.  
We are fortunate to count on such partners as the Canadian Red Cross, CARE Canada, World Vision, CECI and many other Canadian relief organizations. 
They are coming forward as we speak with proposals to provide humanitarian assistance in their area of expertise. 
We are assessing these proposals and will soon announce how they will complement ongoing efforts.  
We will continue to adapt our assistance to the situation. 
Members can be certain that Canada, through CIDA, will still be there when the time comes to help the region pick up the pieces and build the foundation for a lasting peace. 
Even now we are in contact with other donor countries and multilateral organizations. 
Let us not forget that when the military intervention has concluded, when the security situation is stabilized, our work with the international community will continue.  
As we work to rebuild peace and stability in the region the role of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will be of critical importance. 
Canada has been a lead supporter of the tribunal. 
To date CIDA has provided over $2 million to this tribunal. 
We are committed to ensuring that the tribunal will be fully effective in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis.  
We were there with humanitarian assistance and observers before. 
We are responding to the basic needs of refugees now. 
We stand ready to consider reconstruction and peacebuilding in the future.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the official opposition is very happy to see that the minister has responded with immediate aid to alleviate the suffering that has taken place, which, as we have seen on our television screens, is horrific. 
I also thank the minister for having contact with the NGOs.  
We have already spent $22 million in trying to alleviate suffering. 
When the minister of immigration announced that 5,000 refugees would be coming in, the estimated cost was over $100 million. 
It is understandable that the High Commission for Refugees has said that the Kosovar refugees should stay within the region.  
What does the hon. minister anticipate? 
Is she satisfied with the way things are going and, if not, how much more does she think Canada can commit to aid and ensuring that the refugees have at least a reasonable standard of living in those regions?  
Hon. Diane Marleau:
Mr. Speaker, the commitment that was made by the minister of immigration was the cost to receive these refugees for a certain period of time. 
It was just an estimate. 
To date we have responded to requests from UNHCR and from the World Food Program and will continue to do that.  
I cannot say how much more it will cost. 
It all depends on how long the conflict lasts, what the conditions are, and how soon the refugees can go back. 
We are prepared to respond to all requests that come to us and to do our fair share as a member of NATO, as a country that cares and wants to help these people.  
Over the next few months as the situation progresses members will hear more and more announcements. 
I know we will be doing more than we have done so far.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this debate. 
It gives us a chance to reassess the situation since what we are facing is political failure, humanitarian failure and now military failure in the area. 
Bringing refugees over as they are undocumented would be a nightmare. 
They live in a terrible purgatory.  
Is the minister willing to put as much money and effort into humanitarian success as has been put into bombs being dropped on innocent civilians both in Yugoslavia and Kosovo? 
Both of those peoples should know that we support them in every way we can, but we cannot allow a humanitarian failure when our objective was to prevent it.  
Hon. Diane Marleau:
Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to do everything possible to work with the other countries involved to ensure that the people, those refugees, have some care, have some security and have some chance of having a decent life.  
It is not an easy task but together we are making a difference. 
My reports indicate that for the most part the camps are now better organized. 
Food is getting to the people. 
It will be an even bigger challenge when the day comes and we have to help them return to their land. 
We are prepared to help them at that point with reconstruction, as we were prepared to help when Hurricane Mitch struck in Central America. 
Canada will definitely do its share as a caring nation.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Minister of International Co-operation about the co-ordination of these efforts.  
We have heard from the minister of immigration and the minister of defence today. 
I have had calls to my office from constituents offering to help, to volunteer. 
I am wondering if the minister could spend a couple of minutes answering my question. 
I know there is a 1-800 number, but what advice would she give to Canadians who want to open their hearts and help?  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am afraid the Minister of International Co-operation will have to take less than a couple of minutes.  
Hon. Diane Marleau:
Mr. Speaker, my suggestion to these people is that they contact the many organizations listed on our website. 
They are the people we work with who are present in the area. 
Also, as much as possible, if there are donations, that they be in cash rather than in kind. 
It is better for us because it is extremely costly to transport things to the region. 
We only transport those things that are asked for. 
We try to get the best price for everything.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the weight of the words spoken today in the Chamber must not be diminished in any way by the participants in this debate.  
That is so irrespective of whether we endorse or question the continued involvement of this country in the battle to alleviate the suffering of the people of Kosovo.  
We are witnessing intense images of horrendous suffering by the Kosovar people. 
The information available and the intelligence gathered indicate that President Milosevic is engaged in wholesale efforts to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of the large majority of Albanian muslims. 
The result of these atrocities has led the member states of NATO to do all possible to protect the Kosovars and prevent this tyrant from attaining his goals.  
The discussion in the media and elsewhere has queried the role of NATO in this action instead of the United Nations. 
As a collective security organization NATO should respond defensively and not offensively, but events in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have twice provoked the intervention of NATO to protect its citizens from their unscrupulous leaders.  
The argument that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a sovereign state is not to be taken lightly but compels us to consider, as I stated at the outset, whether a state's claim to sovereignty is sufficient to allow that state to engage in actions against its people which contravene the rule of law and deny the very basics of human security.  
At what point does Canada and the countries with which we have formed alliances decide that sovereignty is no shield from responsibility, that the very raison d'être for a sovereign state is its obligation to provide for the well-being of its citizens.  
Sovereignty cannot be used as an excuse to permit an atrocity or to engage in ethnic cleansing that borders on genocide. 
When a country engages in such activities the analogies of history intrude. 
We are compelled to risk acting outside the precepts of international law as it has to date been applied and take the action we have engaged in thus far, and actions that may be proposed, to stop the possible destruction of a people.  
It cannot because they will break every value we hold basic and every human norm we hold as minimal.  
We are by the very definition of our democratic societies compelled to do all that is possible and effective to assist the people over whom they hold power.  
Let us recognize the turn in the road we have taken. 
The cold war is no more and the relative security that a two bloc world and a nuclear umbrella provided is likewise no more. 
We have entered a considerably more destabilized international landscape. 
We are today debating the Baltics, a region of Europe that has rarely enjoyed any long term stability and has frequently been the centre of racial foment and hostilities.  
We must look very seriously at the consequences of this military action. 
Are we redefining our foreign policy strategies? 
Are we motivated, as Henry Kissinger might contend, by the compelling need to be partners with our allies to preserve equilibrium? 
Are we moving toward an unqualified support for ethnic self-determination as promoted by Woodrow Wilson? 
The implications of supporting these principles either alone or within coalitions such as NATO are far reaching and of considerable consequence.  
We move into an uncharted legal landscape on the international plane, a landscape of foreboding future entanglements with no clear exit strategies. 
While the humanitarian dimension of the Kosovo quagmire is paramount, the legal precedent of this engagement will survive after the conflict and our remedy are concluded.  
The Canadian government's intention to further the goal of human security at the security council and within our bilateral and multilateral alliances is legitimate from every perspective. 
It is the essential component that African leaders like President Konnare of Mali have defined as vital to the economic and social development of the wartorn countries of that continent.  
The violation of human security in Kosovo is unacceptable. 
The total lack of regard for the rule of law is unacceptable. 
One had merely to watch in astonishment last week on Canadian television as Milosevic's henchman Arkan Raznatovic told viewers that he had no concern over Louise Arbour's charges against him of horrendous war crimes as he refused to accept the legitimacy of the international court and the War Crimes Tribunal. 
These are leaders for whom power is the arbiter, not the law. 
As Hitler demonstrated, in the world of diplomacy a loaded gun is often more potent than a legal brief.  
Milosevic's reign of terror in Kosovo did not just precede the peacemaking efforts at Rambouillet by a matter of months. 
I was in Belgrade and Sarajevo nine years ago with the Canadian Bar Association. 
We were hosted by Yugoslavian lawyers. 
In Belgrade I met a woman lawyer who through great personal courage, I learned, acted for the Albanian Kosovars and did so often through the vehicles of the international jurists and Amnesty International.  
She related incidents of chronic discrimination and denial of human rights. 
There comes a time when we too take some risks in coming to the Kosovo defence.  
The decisions before us cannot be relished and seem almost contrary to every precept I hold integral. 
As Dylan maintained, God was on no warrior's side.  
The times were to have changed but the horrendous suffering we are seeing in Kosovo is witness to the fact that much has not changed. 
The people of the international community must accept and promote the application of force in containing a demagogue like Melosevic who knows no bounds and knows no morality.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to what my colleague said. 
I was quite moved by many of the comments she made. 
I know her personally and I think she put her point of view forward very well.  
When she started her comments, she said that we have to be very careful as to what we say and to make the right decision here. 
Would she not think it is right for parliament to debate and for parliamentarians to be held responsible by their constituents if in the future, not now but in the future, Canada is going to commit ground forces, its soldiers, in the war? 
Does she not think it is the right of parliament and parliamentarians to debate and vote on that issue?  
Ms. Aileen Carroll:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for his question. 
While I value his point of view, I believe we must contain ourselves to the question at hand, which is to engage in a debate on the action that is before us, on that action that is being taken.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious how very moved my colleague across the floor is.  
Recent opinion polls indicate that women are less prepared than men to accept war, even as a means of settling differences, as is the case at present.  
Under what circumstances would my colleague consider a war to be just?  
Ms. Aileen Carroll:
Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
It is indeed a question I considered as I looked up into the galleries today and saw the young people who were here to observe their representatives debate a critical issue.  
One could spend a long time as my learned colleague knows in a discussion of what constitutes a just war. 
From my remarks I have not only brought forward the amount of thinking that was necessary for me in preparing to speak today, but also the analysis I believed necessary before I could stand in the House and say that the evil we are observing and the terror being imposed upon a people is at such a level that we are justified in responding with force and with military might.  
Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this debate is definitely not a theoretical one, because a number of members of this House have relatives in the Canadian armed forces. 
That is why this matter must be addressed most seriously.  
This reminds me of all the negotiations in which the former Prime Minister was involved at the time of the Gulf War, in which the United Nations was finally led to a more concerted action.  
It is our opinion that, with what is going on in Kosovo at the present time, Canada's international role is not an optimum one. 
It is our impression that we are somewhat at the beck and call of other NATO members when it comes to decision making, and I find that a pity.  
In order to reassure us before there is any direct ground force involvement-since it is the children of all of us who will be called upon to go over there-I would like to ask my colleague how she perceives the decision making process. 
Does she see a debate in the House of Commons with a specific vote on a very specific question? 
Are we going to commit our young people to a ground intervention in Kosovo?  
Ms. Aileen Carroll:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
We are members of NATO. 
This one in particular works through discussion and works through participation by all members in the decisions taken.  
Article 5 of NATO makes clear and puts forward that if any one of the 19 members is attacked, such action will result in all 19 members coming to that member's defence. 
This is not a defensive action, but still the logistics and the role that Canada plays as one of those 19 members is such that we too are very much a part of the decision making process. 
We are equal with the other states in bringing our views to the decisions.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address this House once again, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, during the debate on the government's motion asking that this House take note, and I quote: 
-of the continuing human tragedy in Kosovo and the government's determination to work with the international community in order to resolve the conflict and promote a just political settlement for Kosovo that leads to the safe return of the refugees.  
So far in this debate, we have had few answers to our questions. 
Yet, Canadians and Quebeckers expect the government to provide answers to our questions, because they feel concerned by the crisis in Kosovo and because the Liberal government has only provided them with very limited and fragmented information.  
Incidentally, during a speech delivered at McGill University's law faculty on Thursday, April 8, Canada's former ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations, Yves Fortier, did not hesitate to criticize the Prime Minister for his lack of transparency regarding Canada's position and action in the Kosovo conflict. 
We endorse that criticism, and the government must listen and change its attitude.  
Like all the other governments of the Atlantic alliance, the Government of Canada is probably uncomfortable admitting that it underestimated the crisis in Kosovo and particularly Slobodan Milosevic's genocidal intentions. 
These governments do not seem to have learned history's lessons, otherwise they would know that the attitude of the Serb leader and of his security forces toward Kosovars is quite similar to their attitude toward Croatians and Bosnians, and to that of other political leaders-do we have to name them?-toward 
populations whose presence on their territory was deemed undesirable.  
Like its allies, this government did not accurately assess Milosevic's strategy. 
It allowed itself to be dragged along by events, essentially reacting by resorting to air strikes, while pretending not to be considering a ground military option to end the exodus of the Kosovar people, to check the ethnic cleansing and to prevent a new genocide.  
The about-face of the Minister of National Defence on the need to sent troops is the most deplorable example of the improvisation and lack of leadership of the Government of Canada in this conflict.  
Today, after 19 days of air strikes and a massive exodus of Kosovars, the government has still not answered the most basic question. 
Must it consider sending in ground troops to put an end to such an exodus, to the resultant ethnic cleansing and, especially even more, to prevent the genocide of the Kosovar people?  
We put this question when ministers Eggleton and Axworthy appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and throughout our interventions of the past 10 days. 
We have once again called the government on this question today.  
Will the Prime Minister and his ministers be continuing for long their silence on this basic issue or will they consider that public opinion, both Canadian and Quebec, which, we learn, is prepared to support intervention by ground troops, is now entitled to an answer on this issue?  
Intensifying bombing did nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
Furthermore, if Milosevic persists, he will be able to keep Kosovo, having emptied it of its Albanian inhabitants. 
Even in the case of a campaign of air strikes in which all Serbian vehicles and the entire Serbian war machine were destroyed, Milosevic would still be the one occupying Kosovo, on his own.  
Therefore air strikes have their limits. 
A plane cannot differentiate a Serb soldier from a Kosovar passer-by. 
Moreover, the closer to the ground our planes are flying, the more dangerous it becomes for them. 
But again Milosevic believes NATO will not send in ground troops to ferret him out, and he is playing a game of attrition.  
But this is not the only issue the Bloc Quebecois is interested in. 
My party believes Canada has not used all the means at its disposal to find a solution to the conflict in Kosovo. 
Beside taking part in the air strikes, Canada should have diversified and still can diversify its actions to put as quick an end as possible to ethnic cleansing and, I will say it again and I cannot overemphasize it, to prevent the genocide of the Kosovar people.  
Until now, the minister of Foreign Affairs has not seen fit to use Canada's seat on the UN Security Council to have the UN play a role in this conflict. 
Even though his participation today in Brussels in the meeting of the foreign affairs ministers of the Atlantic alliance is aimed at evaluating the present and future action of NATO, should he not now sponsor, within this forum and the United Nations, a new formula to deal with the political problem created by the conflict in Kosovo, called ``a war without images'' by some.  
If the Rambouillet accords are no longer relevant, should Canada not bring to the security council a proposal aimed at putting Kosovo under the protection of the United Nations pending a negotiated settlement of the crisis?  
If it is as concerned with the rule of law as it purports to be, Canada should also ask the International Criminal Tribunal's chief prosecutor, Mrs. Louise Arbour, to lay charges of crime against humanity against Slobodan Milosevic, or to make them public if such charges have already been laid, as well as against all the other people responsible for the ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo.  
As a promoter of the rule of law, Canada could also initiate an international public action and ask the International Court of Justice, as Bosnia-Herzegovina has already done with regard to the other conflict caused by Milosevic, to rule on the violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by Yugoslavia.  
The improvisation that has characterised the planning of the humanitarian aid efforts so far must now be replaced by a more effective type of coordination. 
In light of the decisions made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Canada must now concentrate its efforts on providing assistance to Kosovar refugees in camps set up in neighbouring countries so that they can live and survive, in minimally decent conditions, until they can return home.  
It must also facilitate the work of Canadian and Quebec NGOs that have mobilized a lot more effectively to come to the rescue of Kosovars and prevent them from having to disperse against their will, adding to the Armenian and Jewish Diasporas, just to name these two, a new Diaspora that will bemoan the homeland it lost for generations and generations.  
The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo also demonstrates the need for genuine reform of the mechanisms related to maintaining and imposing international peace and security. 
It is not appropriate for NATO to dominate events to the point of becoming the military arm of the international community, while the UN is left out of operations that are of great concern to the community of the world.  
More than ever before, the United Nations' military and financial capacity must be examined in depth, and the vetoes of its permanent members seriously challenged.  
As an applicant for membership on the security council, Canada made a commitment to advocating a genuine reform of that forum. 
Now it needs to convince others on the security council and in the UN family of the urgency for such a reform, and show that its election to the security council counts has not been without effect.  
In concluding, I cannot help but express my frustration-and I do not believe I am the only one in this House-about the Prime Minister's refusal to clearly commit to a debate, followed by a vote, in the event that consideration ought to be given to sending ground forces to Kosovo.  
There has been a Crown prerogative in this area for long enough. 
This must be done away with, and the elected representatives of the people must be given a deciding voice when it comes to sending troops abroad to impose, build or maintain peace.  
If the international community had taken action against Hitler in 1936, 50 million lives could have been spared, and the genocide of the Jewish people avoided.  
Canada can assume a lead role within the Atlantic Alliance and the international community. 
It must stop cowering before a man who has committed and has others commit with each passing day crimes that outrage humanity and that must stop.  
Just as the lovers in Sarajevo were victims of crimes that have gone largely unpunished, the lovers of Pristina must not be allowed to become the victims of the dark machinations and trickery thought up by men to justify their cowardice, to paraphrase Euripides.  
Why go to war 
and cause such pain?  
Why break people's hearts 
Again and again?  
Why let our hate 
Destroy our souls?  
Why strike down love 
While the drumbeat rolls?  
Why orphan children 
Who have done no wrong?  
Why terrify those 
With nowhere to belong?  
Why is there always 
A country at war?  
Why can there not be 
Peace ever more?  
Why do you fight 
Young soldier, so brave?  
Why all these bombs 
And these thousands of graves?  
Why is war necessary? 
Sometimes, too often in fact, because of cowardice. 
Why is war necessary? 
Sometimes for freedom.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand from my colleague's intervention that he supports NATO's involvement in the Yugoslav republic, on the one hand. 
He is proposing that Canada head a UN initiative to make Kosovo a protectorate. 
We know very well that the UN has proven totally incapable of staunching the hemorrhage that started in Kosovo long before NATO initiated its air strikes.  
How is it possible to acknowledge that the UN has been unable to fulfil the role now played by NATO and at the same time ask the UN to provide a solution to the problems it could not initially solve?  
The two are incompatible.  
My colleague mentioned quite rightly and simply cowardice. 
To count on the impossibility of acting in order to assuage one's conscience would be cowardice. 
Seeing that the UN was unable to intervene to resolve the basic humanitarian problem in Kosovo, NATO intervened, and we supported this initiative. 
It would have been cowardice to say ``Since we cannot resolve the problem with the UN, let us do nothing''.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
However, it seems obvious that bombing will not be enough to deal with the situation and prevent ethnic cleansing. 
This is why we are constantly questioning the government about the commitment of ground troops, which it refuses to consider and talk about, even if this issue is the most important and, in my opinion, deserves an answer.  
Regarding the international protectorate, I point out to my colleague that we must consider another solution besides autonomy, as provided for in the Rambouillet agreement. 
Coexistence between Serbian and Kosovar peoples seems impossible and another solution must therefore be found.  
I believe that, as a member of the security council, Canada should at least make an effort, while pursuing military efforts and interventions, to bring the UN to seek a political solution. 
Marginalizing the UN as we are doing now is not the way to resolve the serious crisis it may be facing and the difficulty it will have to deal with a crisis of which it has been kept out.  
There are many ways to ensure UN participation-the security council, the general assembly-and this is the least we should expect from a country that has always acted as a supporter and strong advocate of the United Nations.  
Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, allow me to salute my colleague who, when it comes to international issues, always has a great deal of common sense and knows how to take into account all the human aspects. 
Our colleague is quite aware that the decision to involve our young soldiers, our sons and daughters, cannot be taken lightly.  
I would like to know what he thinks of the present NATO strategy, which relies exclusively on air to ground strikes.  
I would like to ask if he can explain this choice of strategy which, if I may say so, has precipitated the exile of Kosovars. 
It has also resulted in the destruction of all their physical property and the death of thousands of Kosovars.  
We are still not in a position to put a price on the material and human damages caused by this necessary intervention which has not been accompanied by a strategy to counter the invasion by Serb troops.  
Mr. Daniel Turp:
Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that NATO'>s strategy was to favour air strikes, so that the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would quickly, very quickly agree to sit down at the negotiation table.  
It was NATO's hope that the destruction of his military capability would prompt Slobodan Milosevic to seek a peaceful settlement and go back to the negotiation table. 
However, NATO obviously underestimated his ability not only to protect his military arsenal, but also to resist pressure, including international pressure, and thus refuse to go back to the negotiation table.  
I think we underestimated that. 
Even if NATO's foreign ministers maintain that their strategy might work, it has not worked so far.  
Ethnic cleansing is continuing and my great fear, which is shared by others, is that ethnic cleansing will lead to genocide. 
It may be that, technically speaking, we cannot talk about a genocide at this point, but even the closing of the border a few days ago should be cause for concern, because it is the prelude to a possible genocide. 
Under these circumstances, we must anticipate, or at least consider, ground military action.  
We must not let this century end the way it began, with another genocide. 
It is true that military personnel from Quebec and Canada, your sons and daughters, will put their lives on the line if ground troops are sent in, but sometimes the lives of others must be put on the line to ensure the survival of a people. 
We must not let a people, the Kosovars, who contribute to the world's cultural heritage, disappear by being dispersed all over the planet, as the Serb leader is hoping to do.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General for a brief question.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
You were in the chair, and this member already had the opportunity to ask a question of my colleague. 
I would ask that you give me the chance to do so too.  
The Deputy Speaker:
It will be a 30-second question, and the answer will be just as short.  
Mr. Jacques Saada:
Mr. Speaker, I was about to say I can feel all the sincerity in my colleague's remarks, but I have a hard time understanding his premise.  
He is taking the stand that NATO's air strikes have been unproductive. 
Maybe he is in the know and I am not, but nothing indicates that they have been unproductive.  
He contends that the presence of ground forces will make it easier to put an end to ethnic cleansing and to genocide. 
This kind of operation is not a matter of hours. 
I have a hard time understanding the logic of it all.  
We should make a clear distinction between what we wish and what the facts really are. 
Mr. Daniel Turp:
Mr. Speaker, I do not mean to downplay the success of NATO's military operation and the fact that it has indeed managed to destroy a good part of the arsenal of the Yugoslav army.  
Having said that, the outflow of Kosovars was not slowed down during the air strikes. 
As I said earlier, we still have today 80,000 displaced persons within Kosovo who could fall victim of Serbian authorities. 
That would justify the dispatch of ground troops.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.  
It is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate this evening. 
I want to speak on our role in Kosovo, where we are and where I believe we should be heading.  
Today, as NATO has just celebrated its 50th anniversary, it is clear that it has become history's most successful alliance. 
Recently NATO's role in Yugoslavia is the most visible confirmation of the enduring value of a transatlantic alliance for strong security in Europe.  
Kosovo is a region that demands our attention. 
It has historically been subjected to many different types of conflict. 
I would like to look at the historical context in which Kosovo is placed today while shedding some light on the brutal nature of Mr. Milosevic's regime.  
Conflict has plagued Kosovo for hundreds of years. 
The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo is the most recent manifestation of a long history of conflict for Kosovars. 
Time does not allow me to chronicle the history.  
If we look to the period in the mid-20th century following the breakup of Yugoslavia by the axis powers in April 1941, most of Kosovo was incorporated into an Italian controlled greater Albania. 
At this time the Kosovars collaborated with the fascist state. 
Kosovo saw little stability in this period. 
It was not until another oppressive regime took power in 1944 that Kosovars began to see some sort of consistency in their lives, the communists.  
Under the communists, Kosovars were still oppressed. 
In July 1945 the communist-dominated assembly voted for the voluntary union of Kosovo with the republic of Serbia within a Yugoslav federation. 
Yugoslavia's Albanians were treated as a national minority with no right to a republic of their own. 
Clearly the voices of Kosovars were not heard.  
Oppression of individual liberties is the hallmark of the communist regime. 
The state security police, through extensive surveillance and harassment, oppressed Albanians. 
This harassment was so severe that between 1945 and 1966 over 200,000 moved to Turkey.  
The treatment of Kosovar Albanians has consistently been terrible, but it pales in comparison to the depths of depravity that Mr. Milosevic has reached. 
The difference between Mr. Milosevic's reign of terror and what we saw at the period after the war is that Mr. Milosevic wants to murder, rape and squeeze every bit of humanity out of these people.  
I have chosen to look at this time period because it took place in the 20th century context. 
It was only 55 years ago that Kosovo was under the control of a fascist regime. 
It was only 50 years ago that NATO was formed to provide for the collective security of the North Atlantic. 
It was only 24 hours ago when women and children were raped and murdered. 
It was only 24 hours ago when the fathers of these children were lined up against a wall and shot in the back.  
What we are dealing with in this debate is not history. 
It is the present. 
As we speak, atrocities are taking place that cannot be left unnoticed. 
As we sit here this evening, people are being shot like sitting ducks for the entire world to see.  
NATO acted quickly in Bosnia. 
NATO actions in Bosnia illustrate how it was called upon to ensure peace in a military role.  
In 1992 a terrible conflict exploded in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
During the next three years, hundreds of thousands of people were killed and over two million were forced from their homes. 
The missions assumed by NATO in the former Yugoslavia played a critical role in bringing peace to Bosnia, while at the same time affirming that NATO was doing its job quickly and effectively.  
NATO first became involved in the former Yugoslavia in 1992 by deploying ships and aircraft to monitor UN sanctions on the Adriatic and the no fly zone over Bosnia. 
In 1993 this monitoring shifted to enforcement. 
Following the UN security council's adoption of resolution 836 in June, NATO offered close air support to the United Nations protection force, UNPROFOR, that was on the ground in Bosnia. 
Shortly thereafter, NATO began to develop air strike options to help lift the siege of Sarajevo and undertook its first combat action in February 1994 when allied aircraft shot down four aircraft violating the UN no fly zone.  
NATO continued to take a more active role in promoting stability when it bombed a Bosnian Serb arms depot in May 1995. 
The Bosnian Serbs responded by taking UN peacekeepers as hostages. 
Bosnian Serb forces overran Srebrenica and Zepa, safe areas, in July. 
It became clear that diplomacy, humanitarian peacekeeping and humanitarian air strikes had reached their limits, much like the failed Rambouillet agreement.  
Under the authority of UN resolution 836, NATO responded by initiating a three week campaign of air strikes against Bosnian Serb military targets. 
This operation, named Deliberate Force, delivered over 1,000 munitions, including 700 smart bombs and cruise missiles. 
The operation was a success. 
It reached its objective of reducing the threat to Sarajevo and deterring future attacks on the safe areas.  
I cannot stress how important NATO's role was in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
NATO had an objective in Bosnia and it reached it. 
We have an objective in Kosovo and we must reach it too. 
This common objective was the prevention of loss of life and the escalation of violence.  
Many people do not realize how repressive this man is. 
In January of this year observers from the Kosovar Verification Mission discovered the bodies of 45 Albanians in the village of Racak. 
According to the observers the victims, including one child and three women, were killed by Serb security forces. 
The international community was quick to unanimously condemn this act of mass murder. 
But what good does universal condemnation do when people continue to die? 
Our number one priority is to stop the brutal killing and the destruction of human lives and property in Kosovo. 
We need action, not words. 
Acting is what we are doing.  
Following this massacre, Serb forces entered the village of Racak. 
This led to fighting between Serb forces and the separatists in the whole area around the villages. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that over 5,000 people were driven out of this village by the fighting. 
Just today we read in the newspaper reports from Albania of how ethnic Albanian women and girls were publicly stripped and then raped by Serb militia as they tried to leave Kosovo.  
This is absolute madness. 
NATO has taken an active role in the past and should continue to pursue peace and stability.  
As members of this transatlantic alliance, we as Canadians cannot sit idly by and watch Milosevic's reign of terror beat people to the ground. 
We have fought for what we believe in and we should continue to press forward in our fight to relieve the people of Kosovo of their pain. 
How can we not support NATO air strikes? 
Can we sit and watch as women are raped in front of their children, as fathers are shot in front of their children? 
No, I think not.  
It is for people like Milosevic that we have security organizations like NATO. 
As I illustrated earlier, NATO acted in Bosnia-Hercegovina to neutralize the Bosnian Serbs. 
We have spent years ensuring that someone like Milosevic cannot bully people, cannot do as the fascists did in the second world war.  
It was made clear a long time ago that Mr. Milosevic did not see the United Nations and NATO as serious, capable organizations. 
The failure of the Rambouillet meetings illustrated that Mr. Milosevic does not want peace and does not want to stop the killing. 
It makes me proud that we will continue to support our NATO initiative in whatever way we must.  
Our actions must diminish the capabilities of the Yugoslav army and the special forces who have committed atrocities against civilians in Kosovo. 
Our air campaign will allow us to meet this objective. 
It may take some time, but our NATO allies knew from the start that degrading Yugoslavia's military capabilities would take time. 
I think we must remain committed to our present policy of full support of NATO in this air campaign.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Hillsborough for his very articulate remarks. 
He makes a very compelling case for the actions taken thus far in this horrific crisis emerging in Kosovo. 
My question that I would direct to the hon. member is along these lines.  
I know the hon. member was present for the remarks made by the Prime Minister. 
He will recall the Prime Minister's quite accurate statement that there is a need for unity not only in the House but in this country as we support the NATO action or the actions of our troops.  
Can the hon. member think of a more compelling case for an opportunity to have a vote in which that expression could take place on the floor of the House of Commons? 
I can think of none.  
Mr. George Proud:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his remarks and his question.  
I believe that parliament should always play a role in these things. 
I also believe that government is elected to govern and there are certain things that government has to do whether we like it or not.  
Even in one of the most powerful legislatures in the world, that of the United States, the Government of the United States has the power to commit troops to areas of conflict and then the U.S. congress debates it, probably before it happens but most times after it happens.  
This is an ongoing debate among all parliamentarians. 
I would like to see the debate take place, but there are some things that government has to do. 
One does not want to lay one's cards out on the table. 
If one is going to send troops into certain areas, one does not want to tell the people before one does that. 
There are certain things one must let government do and hopefully it will do it in the best interests of all Canadians.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my congratulations as well to the hon. member for Hillsborough for an excellent presentation. 
With all due respect, he did not adequately address in his answer the question of my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party about the vote.  
Perhaps the hon. member for Hillsborough is a bit confused. 
What the opposition is asking for is not whether we commit or vote on committing ground troops at this time. 
We recognize that decision will be made at some time in the future. 
What we were endeavouring to do today during Oral Question Period, and what we will continue to try to do during this debate this evening until the wee hours of the morning I am sure, is to get a commitment from the government that if the government does move to commit ground troops in the future, it will only be after a full and open debate in the House culminating in a vote.  
I do not understand what is so difficult about getting a commitment, not only from the Prime Minister, but from all government members of parliament on that very issue of democracy in this parliament.  
Mr. George Proud:
Mr. Speaker, as I said in the previous answer to my colleague, I think that debate must take place if we are to send ground troops. 
There is nothing in my estimation that is more important than having a debate on this issue.  
The other thing about it is I am not convinced that these air strikes will not do the job. 
We are 21 days into it now and it could go on for a couple more weeks.  
I am sure the damage being done will bring Mr. Milosevic's army and his people to heel at the end of the day. 
I am convinced that the air strikes will do the job. 
I see no reason to say that we should have a vote on it at this time.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague mentioned that we knew how ruthless Milosevic was. 
Under those conditions, knowing how ruthless he was, why were we not prepared for the tragedy that has followed? 
Why were we so unprepared to look after the refugees? 
Why are we still unprepared to look after the humanitarian destruction that has followed?  
We are putting up millions of dollars. 
We are sending people in to look after the refugees. 
We have offered to bring the refugees to Canada. 
I believe Canada does not have to take a back seat to any country in what we have done to give humanitarian aid to these people in the terrible, stressful time they are having.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this debate is a reprise of two earlier debates on October 7, 1998 and February 17, 1999. 
I had posed some questions to opposition parties during the first debate. 
In a very real sense we can see law emerging from this process of discussion and give and take. 
We do not actually need a vote. 
Sometimes we get more consensus the other way.  
They are still there against Germany and Japan but they are anachronisms.  
It is also true that regional security organizations, being legal creatures of the charter and subject to the charter, cannot partake of any legal powers higher than or in conflict with the powers of the security council. 
That is explicit in Chapter VIII of the charter. 
In other words, a regional security organization cannot hoist itself by its own bootstraps into a legal power to use armed force that it does not have under the charter.  
These were rules which, after the one exception of the Korean War in 1950, the world community was able to live under during the cold war because, in spite of some perhaps contemporary views, the cold war system of public order maintained a strong regulation of the political-territorial status quo of Yalta and the other wartime agreements.  
What we have seen though at the end of the cold war is the breakdown of this post-war system of order and the breakdown in consequence of some of those artificial multinational states that were created by the Versaille treaty and maintained by Yalta and other instruments thereafter. 
The new century, contrary to the general view of a century of progress and enlightenment, may well turn out to be the century of inter-ethnic conflict. 
We are rediscovering in a very horrifying way the pre-1914 conflicts in which the Balkans, of course, were the cockpits of Europe as Bismarck said.  
To go back to this general issue, what are we to do in a present situation where a crisis faces the world community, but where, in the view of many governments, action under Chapter VII of the charter is inhibited by the fear-which may or may not be unfounded until it is tested-of the exercise of a veto by a permanent member of the security council? 
Russia or China are the ones that have been fingered.  
It basically stated that although the security council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, if it is blocked by wilful obstruction in the use of the veto then the general assembly has plenary powers to act.  
I think that is a useful precedent. 
I wonder if it could not be used in the present situation if we are unable to take further action compatibly with the charter.  
We must remember that there is no veto in the general assembly. 
An ordinary two-thirds majority applies and the general assembly can be called into being with a 24 hour notice in an emergency situation.  
In the debates in the House, those two debates I referred to, I raised this new concept of humanitarian intervention. 
Admittedly it has some difficult antecedents. 
One was what might be called the colonialist power of intervention asserted in the 19th century by Britain, France, Germany and other countries, sometimes cloaked as reprisals. 
That is generally considered anachronistic. 
Some of us would also remember that during the cold war it was asserted by the bloc leaders on both sides. 
Everyone will remember the situation of the intervention in Hungary in 1956 and Prague in 1968, the so-called hegemonial intervention, that you can intervene to enforce solidarity within your own bloc.  
However, there are other antecedents to this which should not be confused with those past interventions. 
One of the more interesting developments is the attempt to flesh out, to give new parameters defining modalities for this concept of humanitarian intervention which is likely to be the weapon we need to cope with this inter-ethnic conflict that is going to be with us.  
I do regret that it has not been felt possible to involve the United Nations more firmly in the process to date. 
However, there is nothing to prevent the United Nations from being accommodated to the crisis problem solving as it develops.  
The Minister for International Cooperation has already recognized the primacy of the United Nations in the general policy aspects of humanitarian care and control of refugees. 
One had hints which come close to some suggestions on the opposition side that it might be possible to accommodate, within a framework of an international military force now limited to NATO, non-NATO members. 
There is nothing to prevent the United Nations from authorizing an international force in which NATO might be the prime element but which could include Russian troops or other troops. 
It could even be put under U.S. command. 
If this sounds rather strange, it was in fact the solution found in the Korean War of 1950 with an American commander-in-chief but under the political control of the United Nations. 
When he exceeded his powers, and he was a very strong personality, he was fired by his president after consultation with the secretary general of the United Nations.  
The possibility is there and it is possible in a phase 2 of the operations to control the crisis in Yugoslavia. 
That would be the best and most productive way to proceed.  
I would also suggest the use of the world court. 
I listened carefully to the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry. 
He touched on this but I would like to suggest that the court is available and it can give decisions on very short notice, the reasons sometimes come later. 
Fleshing out the limitations to this concept of humanitarian intervention, it cannot solely be limited to one country's own conception of what is right and wrong. 
There are other countries around the world whose jurists have been in touch with me over the last few weeks saying, ``Why can't we do this?'' 
It suggests that we should put this as far as possible in the next phase into United Nations' hands.  
I would also like to get a ruling on the limitations as to aerial bombardment. 
The additional protocols in 1977 in a very real sense limit the capacity to conduct aerial bombardment. 
I think it would help to have a world court ruling on this.  
Why do I speak of law? 
It is simply because I am reminded of another American president, President Kennedy, who had advice from his security advisers, among others, to bomb those missile bases in Cuba. 
President Kennedy's answer was essentially that a great state is not armed solely with the law, it has its armed power, but the essence of wise decision making is to choose those modalities that solve the problem that are compatible with international law.  
I welcome the suggestions that I discern in the opposition and I discern in some of the government answers that there will be an increasing attempt to phase in the operations with the United Nations. 
That is the more traditional Canadian way, that we operate through the international authority, through the United Nations. 
In the particular circumstances, it may not have been possible to be so at the beginning, but it is possible to be so at the end.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
In terms of intervention for humanitarian reasons, here we have NATO, which has historically been a defensive organization, suddenly turning offensive. 
Under what basis, what authority, does he see this happening? 
Why are we not intervening, for example, in East Timor? 
What would happen if an altercation occurred between China and Taiwan? 
What would happen in the Basque? 
What authority is there?  
Surely, as a professor on this topic, he undoubtedly has some thoughts on this. 
What authority does he really see NATO involved in the way in which it is involved in this very aggressive intervention?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney:
Mr. Speaker, NATO was involved because to those making the immediate decisions it was the only organization seen to be ready and able to act. 
However, I have my own doubts about it because the alliance is strictly a defensive one. 
It is even more limited than the normal regional security organization.  
It should not be assumed, however, that there may not be a sufficient legal base in itself. 
Let us face it, in terms of Canadian policies in international organizations, the general assembly is a much more democratic and open body than the security council. 
We have been arguing for a reform of the security council. 
We get nowhere because the veto of the permanent members applies to amendments of the charter designed so the security council can yield to the general assembly.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
We know that Canada is supporting the UN to defend the Kosovars in that war-torn land. 
But while we are debating this issue here tonight to better inform the public, how many children will die? 
How many women will be raped and killed while we have this debate tonight? 
How many seniors will die?  
How far will we have to go?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney:
Mr. Speaker, our role is necessarily limited by the size of our army and by our public defence system. 
There are only four planes, I think.  
Of course, we have no control over the rules of the game. 
Nonetheless, since we are members of NATO, we were asked to co-operate, and we did so for these reasons. 
Even though our contribution is more of a symbol than a display military might, I think that our membership in the alliance created an obligation for us. 
But we must ask whether NATO is adapted to today's reality. 
That is the key question, in my view. 
The renewal of NATO seems to be a pressing issue more than ever.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's support for the suggestion of our leader and our party with respect to the possibility of an OSCE or a UN peacekeeping force as opposed to a NATO force.  
I wonder if the member would also like to comment on the application of article 52 of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties which explicitly forbids coercion and force to compel any state to sign a treaty or agreement. 
In light of that and in light of the element in the Rambouillet accord which put NATO at the heart of peacekeeping, does the hon. member not feel that there is a conflict?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney:
Mr. Speaker, on the first question which the hon. member raised, certainly part of the consensus that emerged during our two debates in October last year and in February was looking toward international organizations. 
If it could not be a force sanctioned by the security council, then it could be the OSCE, which has the advantage of having the former Soviet Union as a member. 
Therefore, we would have its co-operation.  
Nevertheless, like NATO it is also an organization that in many respects is out of date. 
It is there to preserve the Helsinki accords, which themselves were to preserve the Yalta division of Europe. 
I am not sure that the OSCE is the answer. 
I would say that we should go back to the general assembly.  
I respect article 52 of the Vienna convention and the member's interpretation of it.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I value the opportunity to participate in this very important and significant debate. 
I deeply regret the decision of the government to equivocate with respect to the role of parliament and the role of each elected member of this House in making a decision with respect to the issue of the possible use of ground troops. 
I do not understand why it is that our government and our Prime Minister have taken the position which ultimately amounts to contempt for the role of elected representatives.  
I listened with interest to the Conservative questioners. 
I rose in this House 19 days ago on behalf of my colleagues to speak in another debate. 
It was a take note debate with respect to the pending decision to support the use of NATO aerial attacks in Kosovo. 
We were then faced with compelling and moving evidence of an impending humanitarian disaster, one which in many respects had already started to take place: the burning of villages, the destruction of people's homes, mass expulsions, murder, torture and rape.  
I remember vividly the assurances given by ministers, privately, in committee and elsewhere, that this firm course of action with air strikes would bring an early return to the negotiating table and hopefully an end to the ethnic cleansing which all of us in this House deplore.  
At that time, in the absence of what we felt was any other viable alternative to stop the humanitarian tragedy, we supported the decision to proceed.  
Today, 19 days later, where are we? 
We know that our troops, based at Aviano and elsewhere, have performed an outstanding job under very difficult circumstances. 
We know the fear of their families and indeed their own fear at a time like this and we extend our support to them, as well as to the aid workers on the ground.  
We are deeply impressed by the incredible generosity of Canadians who have opened their homes and their hearts to refugees. 
It has not happened yet, but certainly I know my hon. colleague from Winnipeg North Centre and others have been playing a leading role in encouraging our government to continue this generosity.  
Here we are 19 days later with NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels. 
What have they come up with in terms of new approaches and a new strategy? 
They have decided to continue the air attacks. 
Continue, keep going, make them even stronger.  
Their villages continue to be burned and they continue to be raped. 
Why bomb a Yugoslavian car plant which also involved the killing of innocent civilians?  
My colleagues and I have all had harrowing personal stories told to us by those who are affected by this tragedy. 
He has no idea. 
There is fear and uncertainty in not knowing what is happening to them.  
How do we answer these anguished questions of our constituents and, indeed, of Canadians?  
Today our leader, the hon. member for Halifax, called once again on our government to put diplomacy and negotiations and not bombing at the heart of our strategy. 
She reiterated the call which my hon. colleague from Halifax West and I made at the meeting of the national defence and veterans affairs committee on March 31. 
With those two conditions accomplished there would be a return to the table.  
When we get to the table there are a couple of key points that must be considered. 
In fact, given the inclusion in the Rambouillet accord of the provision for NATO peacekeeping troops, I think many of us in retrospect would say that this was an impossible condition for Milosevic to take back to the Serbian government. 
One alternative, of course, is not to have a NATO peacekeeping force but a force under United Nations jurisdiction, under OSCE jurisdiction. 
Instead we heard again today from our Minister of National Defence the statement that he made as recently as last Friday, that this has to be a NATO-led force. 
That is fatal to any significant negotiated agreement in this area.  
We appeal to the minister to recognize that and to recognize the absolutely critical role that Russia must play as well in these negotiations. 
It has been effectively sidelined, silenced and shut out. 
It proposed a G-8 meeting. 
We understand that may happen and we welcome that. 
However, both in negotiations and in peacekeeping on the ground Russia must be involved.  
What form will Kosovo take after negotiations? 
It is very difficult to say. 
There again, Rambouillet is likely a dead letter. 
To talk about autonomy within the context of what has taken place recently is very difficult to imagine. 
It may be that there will be some sort of international protectorate, but we will have to examine that with care.  
The fundamental point that we as New Democrats are underlining is that the United Nations and the OSCE must play the leading role in negotiations. 
We called for a special emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. 
Once again, we are appealing for that.  
I am splitting my time, Mr. Speaker. 
I have a couple of minutes left, so I will try to be brief.  
We are calling for a special meeting of the UN general assembly. 
At the same time we want to acknowledge the very important contribution made by groups such as Project Ploughshares, Veterans Against Nuclear Arms, the Regina Peace Council, the Canadian Peace Alliance, Voices of Women, End the Arms Race and many others in urging an alternative approach, an approach that involves peaceful negotiations.  
NATO is clearly not the answer. 
There is a double standard in NATO's approach. 
It is silent, for example, on the appalling situation of the Kurds in Turkey. 
Then there is the approach taken by the United States within NATO. 
We call, along with Project Ploughshares and others, for a new mechanism to legitimize within the framework of the United Nations peaceful humanitarian intervention.  
I want to again note our thanks to those groups- 
The Speaker:
Perhaps in the questions and comments you could mention them. 
I will now entertain questions and comments.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Early in the fall we passed another resolution. 
At the security council we had stoppage and intransigence.  
However, there have been some helpful signs, some from unexpected quarters. 
In this area history has shown that not everyone comes into this situation with totally clean hands.  
During part of the last two weeks I have talked to many people in my riding, including Serbian Canadians, who have real concerns and maybe a different point of view. 
I support what we are doing within NATO, but I would welcome some intervention by the UN.  
Russia has given some indication of wanting to involve itself in negotiations. 
What is the member's feelings on the involvement of Russia as a potential broker of a new rapprochement between these parties?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues have said it is the key. 
There is no question that Russia must be involved at the heart of these negotiations. 
That is one of the reasons we have called for that consistently.  
Russia's position with respect to NATO peacekeeping troops is that it is a non-starter, so we have to re-examine that as well.  
Our government could show some leadership in convening, both within Canada and internationally, some sort of an international forum to seek alternatives to simple air strikes and bombing. 
There is that wisdom and we should be calling on it, both in Canada and internationally.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we were talking about debates advancing and I think there has been some advance in thinking on both sides since the two earlier debates we have had on this general issue.  
Bearing in mind his strictures against treaties made under duress, could the hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas envisage a new diplomatic negotiating process that might produce a more even-handed disposition for either the present government of Yugoslavia or a successor government? 
In other words, does he have something more concrete in mind, accepting the premise that Rambouillet essentially would have been, as he said, a treaty imposed under duress as settlement?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Certainly we could look within the umbrella of the United Nations. 
We have also suggested that there may very well be wisdom in the general assembly itself. 
In his own comments the hon. member alluded to the importance of involving the UN general assembly and not just the security council. 
We may be able to bring that wisdom in to involve Russia directly in the process of decision making and ultimately negotiation.  
If we are to achieve that success in negotiation, we have to be prepared to get back to the table without a whole list of preconditions. 
That is what our leader has called for today. 
That is what we are repeating at this time. 
For God's sake, let us recognize not a whole list of preconditions, stop the ethnic cleansing and the atrocities, stop the bombing, get back to the table and arrive at a peaceful solution that will allow all of the those who have been driven from their homes to return to their homes, that will allow for reconstruction and that will allow for just as many resources to be put into healing and rebuilding as have been put into violence and bombing.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, could the hon. member comment on the long term impact that Canada's involvement in the Kosovo crisis will have on Canada's reputation?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is any doubt that this is a serious concern. 
That is all the more reason for Canada to finally show some independence, to reach out and to show leadership internationally in brokering a solution that will restore the reputation we have fought so hard to establish.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the very important subject of today's debate.  
I believe I can truthfully say that in all my 35 years of public service this is one of the most difficult issues I have ever had to grapple with. 
It was a struggle. 
We were basically taking a position and making a decision around an issue to which I am fundamentally opposed, the use of violence. 
It is violent. 
Bombing is violent. 
No matter how smart we say these bombs are, it is a violent approach to this problem.  
However, we concluded that because of seriousness of the atrocities and the senseless slaughter taking place, which we saw coming across our TV screens with men, women and children suffering, with young children crying and being separated from their families, we would lend our support to try to bring this senseless slaughter to an end. 
That has been the thrust of the NDP throughout this whole business, to bring an end to the terrible situation we are faced with.  
Last Friday I attended a peace rally in Halifax organized by the Voice of Women and some other organizations. 
One of the people primarily responsible for organizing it was a women over 90 years of age, Maria Duckworth who worked all her life for peace and harmony. 
The people at that rally made it very clear that they were opposed to bombing Yugoslavia. 
They talked about the legality of the action being taken. 
They stressed their concerns about the innocent people who were being slaughtered in the whole process. 
I assured them that we would certainly carry forward their voice and their concerns into the debate tonight.  
We talk about ethnic cleansing. 
I would like to say right off the bat how very much I abhor that phrase. 
I know many members use that phrase, including members of my caucus. 
I suggest that we are not dealing with ethnic cleansing. 
When we talk about cleansing we know that when we clean something it is because something is dirty. 
We wash our cars because they are dirty. 
We scrub our floors because they are dirty. 
We wash our hands because they are dirty. 
We try to cleanse these things. 
When we talk about a people being purged and driven from their country and being slaughtered because someone is not content with the ethnic background of the particular group of people, that is not a cleansing process. 
It is war. 
It is crime against humanity. 
That is what it is so we should call it that.  
We see the results of that. 
We see countless numbers of refugees fleeing their homes. 
We see young children coming across the border on bicycles so traumatised that they cannot talk about what is happening.  
On the way here today I read in the paper about women, young girls being taken from the caravans as they were trying to cross the border, being stripped publicly, taken back into fields and raped. 
These are the things that are happening and we must come to grips with them.  
There is another side of the issue that we do not hear about. 
I wish to point out a special side effect of the bombing of which little has been said: the actions of the NATO pact are so wide, that in the first phase they can already be characterized as absolute war which means the destruction preconceptions-cultural, spiritual and natural lives of millions of people in our country.  
The toxic nature of the 19,200 tons of explosives (equal to the amount used in the Nagasaki bombing) used is well known to you. 
We warn you that Serbia is one of the greatest sources of underground waters in Europe and that the contamination will be felt in the whole surrounding area all the way to the Black Sea.  
It then goes on to talk about the national parks and the various factories that were hit: 
Numerous civil targets in other cities were hit-schools, hospitals, the sites considered as cultural monuments.  
Especially worrying are the latest news saying that, in the next phases of their bombing, NATO will use the airplanes B1 and A10 which are carrying missiles with depleted uranium previously used in Iraq and Bosnia. 
The use of these will bring about the vast dangerous consequences to the health not only of the soldiers, but also of the whole population, and you know that the toxins and the radioactivity know no nationality or borders.  
This person went on to describe some of the things being experienced by the people in Serbia.  
In reality war has no winners. 
Someone may end up victorious but in reality there is no winner. 
Everyone suffers as is evident by this conflict. 
It emphasizes that we need to have as impartial a body as possible to deal with the international conflicts and the conflicts within sovereign states. 
We need to strengthen the UN for this purpose. 
It will not happen overnight, but it will never happen as long as we keep ceding power to NATO and not looking directly at where we should be focusing our attention in terms of strengthening the security council and the UN. 
Canada should be taking a leading in role in this measure.  
I am very pleased that Canada responded so favourably when it appeared that we were to have many refugees coming here.  
I think of the small town of Greenwood, Nova Scotia, and how the people rallied around, got all kinds of supplies and got ready to receive refugees they thought were coming. 
In times of crises like this one it shows what Canadians are really made of when we open our hearts to other people. 
This is key to the whole thing, opening our hearts to other people.  
As we debate the issue tonight it should not be a we and they kind of issue. 
I encourage us to work together in the spirit of love and the spirit of harmony to try to bring all our collective thoughts to bear on the issue and to use every means possible to bring about a peaceful negotiation.  
Many suggestions have been made as to how this might be done and I will not repeat them. 
At this time I would like to say in conclusion that my thoughts and prayers go out to all who are suffering, the many people in Kosovo who have been forced to flee from their homes, who have been separated from their families, and all the people in Serbia who are experiencing terrible bombing. 
It must be terrible to have bombs falling around them as they try to lead their daily lives. 
Our men and women in the military are working hard to try to deal with the situation. 
The people in immigration are working hard with the refugees as are the people providing international aid. 
All these people are in our thoughts and our prayers as we work together to try to resolve this problem.  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what does the hon. member think about NATO being there? 
Does he feel we are achieving anything? 
Does he feel we are there as a lost cause?  
Does the hon. member think that the NATO forces are sensitive to the history of the Balkans and are sensitive to the fact that two world wars almost started from the Balkans? 
Does the hon. member think that NATO is achieving anything there and, if so, what?  
Mr. Gordon Earle:
Mr. Speaker, initially everyone had the intention and the hope that the matter would be quickly resolved but this has not happened.  
Quite honestly at this point I have questions as to how effective the bombing campaign is. 
That is why we are calling for a reassessment of the situation and a serious look at what strategy can be utilized to bring an end to it.  
I agree with the many people who have already spoken about the role it is felt Russia should play. 
We should be making every concrete effort to get a commitment from Russia to try to lend its influence with its Slavic brothers to end this conflict.  
I certainly feel we have to branch away from what NATO is doing and move beyond it because it certainly has not accomplished the goal we hoped would be accomplished.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech. 
He made one statement that really touched me when he said that war had no winners. 
When we take a look at the issues that were confronting us in World War I and again in World War II certainly that is true.  
Would the hon. member not agree, if we bring this to a successful conclusion, that the only people who could be winners would not necessarily be the Serbs or the Kosovars who are fighting but the women, children and elderly? 
If we can provide them with homes again and give them their freedom, I believe they would be the only true winners who could come out of this conflict. 
I would like the hon. member to comment.  
Mr. Gordon Earle:
Mr. Speaker, I agree those are the important people we should be concerned about. 
They have already lost so much that it would be difficult to say that they will come out winners. 
Many of them will be coming out violated, traumatised or have lost their families. 
The men have been taken, put in places and in many cases shot. 
In a lot of cases they are still losers, but they would certainly be much further ahead if we could bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two brief questions for my hon. colleague. 
I thank him for the work he has done on this very important issue.  
First I would ask for an affirmation from my hon. colleague of the longstanding commitment of New Democrats to the fundamental right of self-determination of the people of Kosovo, basically reaffirming that commitment to their right to self-determination, to determine their own future and also obviously, for help in the reconstruction of their shattered society when they do return to their homes.  
Second, would the hon. member comment briefly on the suggestion made by Senator Doug Roche, a very important suggestion, that we have another look at the agenda for peace that Boutros-Ghali published some time ago, an essential element of which was the creation of a rapid reaction force under UN auspices? 
Mr. Gordon Earle:
Mr. Speaker, on the first question, I agree 100% that it is very important that people be able to determine their own future. 
It is for that very reason I deplore the term ethnic cleansing. 
As I mentioned during my speech, that term implies superiority and inferiority, where something has to be cleansed because one is better than the other.  
That gets to the very heart of the principle of self-determination. 
Even here in Canada we can look at that principle and apply it to our aboriginal peoples. 
We should be looking at that same concept of self-determination and the right to determine one's future when we talk about our aboriginal people.  
On the rapid reaction force, I certainly agree that we have to strengthen the United Nations to be able to respond quickly and efficiently to these kinds of crises. 
With each day that goes by, more and more lives are lost. 
We should see the common bond of humanity and try to end the suffering. 
Every time a person dies, we lose.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  
I think it is fair to say that Canadians everywhere are concerned about the crisis in Kosovo. 
The people in my riding of Waterloo-Wellington share grave concerns about what is happening in that part of the world and are watching closely as events unfold.  
How did we get to the point where we now find ourselves? 
The international community has gone to great lengths to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo. 
It is clear that Canada and NATO would prefer to resolve the problems in that part of the world through a negotiated settlement based on the Rambouillet agreement, but as United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said recently, diplomacy sometimes cannot work without the threat of force.  
Unfortunately we had no choice but to resort to force to halt what had developed into an intolerable situation. 
We had run out of peaceful options when Slobodan Milosevic rejected every peace proposal submitted to him. 
Meanwhile he stepped up a campaign of terror by Yugoslav authorities that has been going on for several months and it is continuing right now as we speak tonight. 
We have seen well documented evidence of forced expulsions, the destruction of whole villages and the massacre of civilians by Yugoslav security forces.  
Earlier this year the situation started to deteriorate again. 
By March 20 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, was forced to evacuate the Kosovo verification mission, the KVM, because of the collapse of the ceasefire and the unacceptable threat to the safety of mission members. 
With the departure of the verification mission, Yugoslav forces dramatically stepped up their brutal offensive.  
The Yugoslav government is in clear and flagrant violation of the commitments it agreed to in October. 
It has violated the ceasefire and responded disproportionately to the actions of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA. 
In addition to not respecting several UN security council resolutions, Yugoslavia has systematically violated the most basic rights under international humanitarian law. 
It has unleashed a savage and calculated campaign of hatred and violence not only against members of the KLA, but against the civilians of Kosovo, against families. 
This is offensive, this is wrong and this must be stopped.  
Canada and its allies simply could not stand by and do nothing while women and children, men and the elderly in Kosovo were being killed, tortured, detained, persecuted and banished from their homes and stripped of their very identities because of their ethnic background, because of who they are. 
In the name of humanity we cannot and we should not and we will not stand by while this takes place.  
Last September this house unanimously supported a resolution calling on the government of the federal republic of Yugoslavia and the parties involved in this inhumane confrontation to lay down their arms and to negotiate a solution with help from international organizations. 
In addition, in October all parties took part in a take note debate and expressed their support for Canada's involvement in Kosovo. 
Members of parliament have also been kept up to date on the developments in Kosovo via standing committee briefings.  
Since then we have been closely following developments in that part of the world. 
Now many fellow Canadians and the country as a whole are engaged in the debate on what Canada should or should not do and on NATO's role in this crisis. 
Since the start of NATO's military action there has been considerable public debate and media coverage examining the very issues from every conceivable angle. 
Unlike any time in the past, Canadians have access to a wealth of information that they can sift through to form their own opinions at this time.  
From all indications I have seen, most Canadians support the action taken by their government and by NATO. 
When a regime abrogates political rights, stirs hatred, shuts down the press, burns villages, herds civilians into becoming hostages... it is difficult to defend its legitimacy. 
Over many years, Milosevic has done all of this. 
Yet human-rights-respecting countries are debating whether they have the moral right to intervene. 
Get serious.  
As a government we still favour a diplomatic solution that ensures sustainable results and long term security in the region. 
I know that Canadians want this to happen. 
This diplomatic solution can be achieved if, as NATO has suggested, Belgrade authorities cease the savage repression of their own people and sign a peace agreement giving significant autonomy to Kosovo.  
I think most Canadians would rather not have to resort to military force, but they believe Canada and NATO are nevertheless on the right track given the current grim circumstances. 
We must not lose our resolve to make tough choices to ensure an effective and lasting resolution to the situation in Kosovo and the humanitarian catastrophe in that region.  
Having made our commitment, I believe that Canada must now follow through to ensure a lasting peace in that part of the world. 
It is important given all that has happened that we now stay the course to bring about stability in that part of Europe. 
We will do so knowing this is not an easy position nor a lightly taken decision. 
We do so knowing that at the end of the day it will be judged as the right thing to do on behalf of the people of Kosovo. 
In the name of humanity, it is the right thing to do.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, every single bomb we drop drives us farther and farther from our objective of peace.  
I have had calls from constituents whose families are in Serbia. 
They said that last year their brothers would not fight but now they cannot wait to fight because they have wholeheartedly turned against the west. 
There are no rules in war. 
When my father fought in the second world war women were not touched. 
When we drop a bomb now, we unleash untold brutality on the very people we want to protect. 
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Mr. Speaker, I said at the outset that United Nations Secretary General Annan said recently that diplomacy sometimes cannot work without the threat of force. 
Unfortunately we are now in the position where having started this course of action we need to follow it through.  
As the hon. member correctly and eloquently points out, terrible things are happening as a result. 
Unfortunately in the name of humanitarianism and in the name of what we think is right, we need to do these kinds of things to ensure that security ultimately is brought to that part of Europe and to the world in general. 
I support that and I think most Canadians do.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, the question is at what cost? 
We agree that the atrocities have to stop. 
The hon. member talks about staying the course. 
It seems to me that we have to define what the course is and where we are going. 
If we get ourselves involved in a war, how are we going to extricate ourselves from that war?  
It is almost as if the Canadian government and other NATO partners are making policy on the fly. 
Canadians were led to believe that the air strikes would be successful within a matter of days. 
There is an assumption that once we send in ground troops, Canadian soldiers, the war will be won at some point if we stay the course.  
That is the same type of thinking which took place not so many years ago in southeast Asia when the Americans went into Vietnam. 
The Speaker:
Order. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that we as the Government of Canada along with our NATO partners tried very hard to get a negotiated settlement. 
We worked diligently to that end for that objective. 
At the end of the day when we saw the kinds of atrocities that were taking place and the kind of humanitarian upheaval, it was important that we act in the way we are now doing to ensure that we bring peace in that area. 
It seems to me that we have gone to great lengths to ensure that.  
We are not in a time of instant gratification and instant war starting and stopping. 
We have to take our time to ensure the right thing and ensure that people and families in that part of the world are protected.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am paraphrasing but someone once said that for evil to succeed it just takes good men doing nothing. 
I see this in this situation.  
Canadians are not used to conflict that is internal, inside a boundary of one jurisdiction or one state. 
My question is about the human security agenda, something we talked about and are now seeing in action. 
I welcome comments from the hon. member.  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Mr. Speaker, human security is the key in all of this and is part of the objective of not only Canada but the NATO partners. 
It is important that we move in that direction to ensure security and stability in a part of the world that has not seen it for many years throughout the century.  
If we can do our part in that area we will have served well not only our country but the world in that area.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as one of our colleagues put it, there are no winners in a war. 
War means untold suffering, the loss of human lives, destruction and devastation on all sides.  
As our colleague from Halifax West so eloquently pointed out, most of us are torn apart by the necessity to resort to weapons for a cause we feel is just, while at the same time realizing that it was brought upon by the revolting genocide going on in Kosovo, where every passing day brings sad pictures of massacres of thousands of innocents victims, mostly women and children.  
Given its tradition of peace and the fact that pluralism is one of its central policies and values, Canada must play a major role in the search for a solution for Kosovo.  
Indeed Canada joined the NATO operation with the central aim of seeking a peaceful resolution of the atrocities in Kosovo and of returning the Kosovars to a normal life in their own homes.  
Our central objective here, in this debate, should be to look for this same solution, eventual peace, so that NATO's current operations can be replaced by sustainable peace measures to restore some form of normal life for the Kosovars.  
Canada can play an important role in this respect.  
It is crucial for us in Canada and for Canada within NATO and the broader international community to maintain an autonomous mind strictly directed toward the establishment of a peaceful solution. 
Military solutions as much as they may be necessary are sometimes never real and complete solutions.  
Canada has a lasting tradition as a peace seeker, as a peacemaker, as an initiator of international peacekeeping through the United Nations. 
Canada must use its undoubted credibility as a peacemaker and peace seeker to play a leadership role in initiating proposals for early peaceful solutions.  
As a non-European country, as a traditional honest broker in resolving international conflicts, Canada must follow its own wise counsel and be proactive, if necessary, sometimes even in contradiction with the U.S. and the Pentagon generals whose operation the NATO intervention has increasingly become.  
I ask this question. 
Does the solution pass through Russia and a constructive Russian intervention in the Kosovo issue? 
If Russia were involved, prospects for settlement would be far less difficult and would certainly be speedier to achieve. 
Indeed Russia may represent the surest chance of achieving an effective ceasefire and an eventual peace guaranteed by peacekeeping and the resettlement of the Kosovars in their own homes. 
Russian participation would eliminate a roadblock within the UN. 
Russia, if it participated, might influence China to take a more positive stance at the UN security council. 
Canada should take the lead in enlisting Russian participation, inciting Russia to play a key part in bringing Yugoslavia to accept Rambouillet or a similar accord.  
One obvious difficulty in establishing a peacekeeping force in Kosovo is the refusal of Yugoslavia to accept a NATO force. 
If a peacekeeping force were to include a strong Russian presence, it may go a long way to influencing Yugoslavia to accept it. 
Even if it meant NATO countries contributing to such participation, it would still be a thousand times preferable to the alternative of military operations continuing on a larger scale.  
As far as the conduct of NATO's operations is concerned, it is important that Canada maintain enough flexibility and autonomy. 
While the United States and some European nations support expanding the operations' scope to include ground troops, Canada should stick to it's initial commitment, which was to send in from 600 to 800 military personnel, but only in a peacekeeping capacity and after a formal agreement was reached to put an end to the operations and make sure that the Kosovars can go back home.  
I think we all agree that military operations are a last resort, that peaceful solutions must be the central collective goal of all of us. 
Canada is a nation of peace and freedom. 
In seeking freedom itself for others it must believe that freedom is best achieved in achieving peace.  
This is what we must seek tonight. 
I would earnestly ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs and my government to do everything possible to enlist the help of the Russians to make a peace settlement possible and to lift the United Nations blockade. 
I hope that peace happens very soon in Kosovo.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief because I know there are many who have comments and questions. 
I thank the hon. member for his very thoughtful remarks and his approach to this tragic situation.  
There was a lot of wisdom in that group. 
They were calling for an end to the bombing, an end to the ethnic cleansing and a return to negotiations.  
Does the hon. member agree that it would be a valuable and important initiative by the Government of Canada to convene a meeting at an early date of civil society, of key partners from the church community and from the labour movement? 
I know Canadian Auto Workers has issued a very important statement with a number of concrete suggestions on how we might approach the situation. 
Today the Canadian Federation of Students issued a similar statement.  
There is not just wisdom within the military and in the House. 
There is a lot of wisdom in the country, in civil society. 
It would be a valuable and important exercise to convene on an urgent basis a gathering in Canada of groups such as that to seek alternatives to the present approach which is merely, according to NATO, reaffirming today more bombing and more air attacks.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
Mr. Speaker, Canada is in a unique position to take a leadership role whether within NATO, whether at the United Nations, whether in the broader community of Canada or whatever we do. 
If this is one way whereby we can bring civil society together to seek solutions, I would certainly be 100 per cent for it.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my learned colleague for the message he brought to the House and indeed his colleague who spoke before him.  
When we hear the news, as all Canadians have, we hear mention of the Serbian army and then the Serbian police. 
Obviously both are involved in this conflict. 
It would seem to me they are involved for different reasons.  
From the information I can get many of the atrocities are associated with the police.  
If this is the case and we bring it to a conclusion, will it be more difficult to attach blame to the police rather than the military?  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
Mr. Speaker, as much as I am flattered by my colleague's faith in my judgment on these issues, I must say in all humility that I just do not know. 
I believe all the elements in society within Yugoslavia that have participated in genocide of any kind, in massacres or in disruption of people's lives on a massive scale should be brought to justice, whomever they may be.  
I cannot say whether the blame is with the police or the army. 
I do not know enough about it from this distance to make a pronouncement, but I believe after this is settled the culprits should be brought to justice.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I too would like to associate myself with some of the comments made by the hon. member. 
I would like to elicit his views on the subject of sending NATO ground troops into Kosovo. 
In my respectful submission it would be a terrible mistake to involve NATO and Canadian soldiers in a ground war that could result in the loss of many lives not only on the NATO side but also on the Serbian side.  
What are the hon. member's views with respect to the sending in of ground troops? 
Would he not agree that it is important for parliament to send a very clear message that it does not support a ground war in Kosovo?  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
Mr. Speaker, I mentioned during my speech that my position was clearly that we should stand by the commitment already made by our country. 
I do not agree that the NATO operation should be enlarged by sending troops of any kind into Yugoslavia.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, as I rise in the House this evening, I pray for all our military personnel serving abroad, as part of NATO's allied forces, and for all of those who are affected by this military conflict, or should I say by this war.  
It is a real shame that this liberal government, the so-called government of openness and accountability, is merely holding another one of these take note debates, at a time when this country and its NATO allies are involved in an armed conflict against Yugoslavia in Kosovo. 
We should have a real parliamentary debate, followed by a motion put to the House. 
This would give the government a mandate to deal with this conflict and allow the Canadian forces to wage this fight properly.  
I think the job of the defence critic for the opposition is to hold the government of Canada responsible for its actions. 
In this case, it is to avoid needless losses of human lives.  
The Liberal government has decided on a foreign policy of ``soft power'' at the expense of military equipment of ``firm power'' and has said to the Canadian people direct threats against Canada and Canadian interests no longer exist.  
Well, I have some news for the people sitting in the first rows. 
First, perhaps their foreign policy is appropriate for signing a treaty on antipersonnel mines, but it is not appropriate for dealing with such people as Milosevic and his government, who kill their own people and then lay antipersonnel mines to keep Kosovars within borders and NATO outside.  
Second, the world is sometimes a jungle and dictators are not afraid to use force.  
Third, all out wars, such as the second world war, may happen only once or twice a century, but unfortunately they happen.  
Fourth, small scale wars, regional wars and civil wars are far more frequent.  
Fifth, there is nothing new about civil wars, which I would like to point out to the historian from Princeton who was surprised by the brutality of Milosevic after years of tragedy in Bosnia.  
This government did not take the history of international relations into account and acted in a criminal fashion by neglecting Canada's defence, for which it is responsible. 
The defence of the realm is a government's primary duty.  
We have here in front of us the Liberal government that cancelled, for purely partisan purposes, a highly needed program, namely the EH-101 helicopter acquisition program. 
It is the Liberal government that sent Canadians to be taken hostage in the former Yugoslavia. 
It is the Liberal government that does not put bread on the table of military families.  
It is the Liberal government that sends teams on search and rescue missions in Labrador helicopters and, when they do not come back, tries to take benefits away from widows and children.  
So do not think for one minute that we will let the government take action blindly in Kosovo and in the sky over Yugoslavia, where a larger number of Canadian lives are in danger. 
The Liberal defence and military management policy has given Canadians Hong Kong and Dieppe, and the list could grow.  
But now that we have been forced to take action by Mr. Milosevic, NATO must wage a war that it must win. 
We are not dealing with nice people in Yugoslavia. 
They are brutal and cunning adversaries who will stop at nothing to get their way and who have absolutely no respect for human life and human dignity.  
NATO has committed to a battle from which it cannot withdraw unless it is victorious. 
Withdrawal at this time would have major repercussions.  
But what is NATO's strategy? 
What is the strategic objective of NATO? 
Can we attain the goals NATO and this government have set?  
Mr. Milosevic is cleansing Kosovo, and he is in the process of attaining his own strategic objective. 
His regime is intact and we have not yet seen the strongest elements of his military machine in action against NATO. 
He is saving them for later. 
He does not appear to be ready to give up, and western journalists report that he has the support of the people.  
What is our objective? 
To put an end to the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, to force Milosevic to pull out his military and paramilitary forces, to get the Kosovar refugees back to their homes and to guarantee their safety under the Rambouillet accord and thanks to the intervention of soldiers responsible for imposing and maintaining peace?  
Historically, the Battle of Britain and the raids on Dresden notwithstanding, it is not air strength that wins wars. 
According to the NATO supreme commander directing this operation, General Clark, the bombardment will not put an end to ethnic cleansing. 
It is advice which is very simple. 
The Canadian forces are well trained, well motivated and have a history which is second to none, but they lack key equipment, in particular the army. 
This government cut military personnel and the defence budget to the bone. 
If Canadians are needlessly killed as a result of government negligence, then this government will be held accountable.  
The present government defined its defence policy with the 1994 white paper, which committed Canada to the maintenance of a modern, combat capable, land, sea and air force to deal with operations across the spectrum of combat.  
In terms of implementing our national security objectives the government directed the Canadian forces to provide a joint task force headquarters and one or more of the following: an able task group of four major service combatants, one support ship and maritime air support, three separate battle groups or a brigade group, a fighter wing and a transport squadron, and all this for a grand total of 10,000 personnel at any one time.  
The intent was to have the vanguard of this joint task force in place within three weeks and the entire force operational within three months. 
This was done having a regular force of 60,000 personnel. 
Can we do this today? 
Probably not. 
If part III estimates for 1999-2000 are to be trusted we are going to be below 60,000 next year.  
In terms of the navy, the government stated that there was an urgent need for new maritime helicopters to replace the aging Sea King. 
Five years later we have not even heard a call for tenders, not even a statement of requirement. 
That is the Liberal definition of urgent.  
The government stated that it would consider replacing old operational support vessels. 
We have not heard a thing about Sealift since.  
Canada's army was promised three adequately equipped brigade groups and some 3,000 more soldiers in three light infantry battalions.  
The white paper called for new armoured personnel carriers to replace the obsolete M-13 fleet.  
There was also a discussion in very loose terms on the future replacement of direct fire support vehicles. 
There was no mention of a new main battle tank to replace the obsolete Leopard. 
An army without a main battle tank will not survive in combat. 
That is the end of that story.  
The army has received most of its new armoured personnel carriers in the form of the LAV-25. 
We have enough of those for a good armoured reconnaissance regiment.  
The air force was promised an upgrade of the CF-18 fighter aircraft fleet. 
That is happening, although the government wants to deny it every time we hear of yet another Sea King emergency landing.  
The CF-18s have received their precision guided munitions, but the air force lost its in-air refuelling tankers and received no new airlift capabilities. 
As of today Canada lacks both strategic sealift and airlift capabilities and thus is forced to rent these items on the open market or be dependent upon the United States for any large military operation.  
The lack of power projection capability is the Canadian forces' biggest problem, after money of course. 
That is the central issue. 
The white paper must be implemented if we are to project our forces abroad effectively in support of foreign policy objectives, including Kosovo.  
Unfortunately, if the Kosovo conflict moves to the next phase, it is likely that we will see NATO ground troops. 
If that is the case, then the government will have to take a long and hard look at the NATO plan and whether Canada has forces that are properly trained and equipped for ground action.  
In terms of ground operations, there are a number of issues that need examination by parliament prior to deployment. 
For instance, what are the objectives of the campaign? 
To create a safe area within Kosovo? 
To partition Kosovo and Yugoslavia? 
Or to invade Yugoslavia? 
How long does NATO make a commitment to stay? 
How do NATO troops, our troops, get into Kosovo considering the geographic realities of the Balkans and the lack of infrastructure in either Albania or Macedonia? 
Will we send a significant contingent, perhaps a battalion size group, or no troops at all?  
We do not know what the national command relationship will be. 
What are the rules of engagement? 
We do not know how we will get our troops over to Kosovo because we have no real sealift or airlift capabilities. 
How will we sustain them in Kosovo? 
We do not know which units of the Canadian forces will be sent, if any, and whether they are trained for the mission before them. 
That is very important.  
Let us remember the criticisms of the Somalia mission and the criticisms that the inquiry directed at the Canadian predeployment to Somalia. 
This deployment to Kosovo could make Somalia look like a Sunday school picnic.  
Are we sending composite units that have never worked with each other before? 
Are they all from one brigade group? 
What size of contingent is going to Kosovo? 
Will we send more CF-18s over to Italy to back up our ground troops and the soon to be increased operational tempo? 
Where are the relief or reinforcements going to come from?  
Will we also maintain our forces in Bosnia? 
Or does this mean that this is the end of the Bosnian commitment?  
I point to the recently released Conference of Defence Associations' strategic assessment that questioned Canada's army organization and our ability to sustain our Bosnian forces. 
They said that as the army is now configured, it uses every resource at its disposal just to maintain that Bosnia commitment.  
Are we going to reorganize the army to better deal with these long term commitments or are we going to maintain our current core configuration and trade one taxing commitment for another that experts claim is destroying the Canadian army? 
I think Canadians want to know the answer to these questions and many more prior to further deployments with our NATO allies and further escalation of this conflict.  
To clear up a couple of points that we had earlier, in 1990-91 there were three debates in the House, and two of them were before a shot was fired. 
No one can say that it is the same situation. 
These were all votes. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
In the fall of 1997 I had the privilege to visit Bosnia with the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
I saw firsthand the consequences of that war on the lives of the people and on the environment. 
It was a travesty to the human condition, one that we must act against.  
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia is aimed at bringing an end to atrocities against civilians in Kosovo by diminishing the capacities of the Yugoslav army. 
The military objective of NATO has humanitarian or political consequences. 
Although the air strikes are planned with the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties, they nonetheless occur. 
We see this.  
I ask the member how do I respond to so many of my constituents who in the main are eastern European, many of them from Serbia? 
How do I speak to them about this issue at present?  
Mr. David Price:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I guess it was more of a statement, a statement I can follow along with.  
I was also in Bosnia. 
I had a chance to talk to the people there, to tour with our troops and to see the terrific job they are doing. 
When I look at what happened in Bosnia it brings it very close to home for myself. 
The area of Bosnia that Canadians are patrolling right now is very similar to my home area, the eastern townships, in the way the grounds are laid out. 
It is very interesting to look at the fields with nothing planted in them. 
They are all mined. 
I look at the job the Canadian troops are doing there to try to get people back to a normal way of life.  
We are talking about a different situation in Kosovo. 
We have to look very clearly at that and what our troops can do. 
All we have talked about in the House, and we never voted on that, is a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. 
If we are going to do anything else at this point, it has to come to a vote.  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague with great interest. 
I was baffled with the way he historically rhymed off some figures. 
He talked about Hong Kong. 
He talked about Dieppe. 
Now he says if they do not behave, we are going to go in there.  
I wonder if my hon. colleague remembers which side of the allies the Serbian people were on. 
I wonder if he remembers or if he knows that these people might have been under Hitler at that time and they were impoverished. 
They were under the German boot. 
Can he tell me if he remembers which side they were supporting? 
Was it the partisans not only of Serbia, but the partisans in Italy, or the partisans in France, or the partisans in Greece? 
I could go on and on. 
He mentioned nothing about it.  
The member talked about the Battle of Britain. 
Has my hon. colleague dismissed all the people under hardship during that period of our history, or has he simply chosen to ignore them?  
My hon. colleague talked about our ability to keep sending troops in and how they are undernourished and what the troops do not have. 
Has my hon. friend across the way a sense of dignity to say that we must act and act in peace without sending bombs in, but get the people back to the negotiating table, or has he forgotten that part of history too? 
Mr. David Price:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question, but I am not really sure what he said or asked. 
I find what he is talking about to be completely irrelevant. 
It is his government that authorized the bombing. 
I do not understand where he is coming from. 
The hon. member is not very clear.  
I made references to the disasters we have had before to come to the point that we do not end up with another disaster of the type that we had in Dieppe or Hong Kong and so on. 
So I do not understand.  
There is a long history in Yugoslavia on both sides. 
It goes back at least 600 years and I am sure it goes back farther than that.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will make a comment and ask a question.  
We should not in any way put our military in danger whether it is rescue or military services on the ground.  
When he did touch upon the debate before us today he spoke specifically about there having to be a war. 
He talked about ``a rise in his popularity at home'' in referring to Milosevic. 
I would like to comment on that. 
How did this individual's popularity rise? 
When somebody sees their children, brothers or nephews being killed, they might not like Milosevic, but they are going to bond together. 
I do not know if the member agrees or not.  
About the second point that there has to be war, why must there be war when right now we are seeking a political solution in my view? 
In order to seek this political solution, does the member agree that the Russians have to come to the table and the Americans must find the will? 
Does he agree with this to really move forward?  
Mr. David Price:
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the member on the point of how Milosevic is becoming more and more popular because of the conflict. 
It has helped his situation.  
The other question was about why there should be war. 
I would like to know what the Minister of Foreign Affairs has done at the security council. 
That is a question we asked today. 
We find at this point that there does not seem to be any results, nothing solid out there. 
The minister has talked a lot, but he has not come back to the House to tell us exactly what he did to try to stop this situation, to try to move things ahead further.  
On the war situation, Milosevic has declared war on NATO. 
So, like it or not, we happen to be at war.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
I want to go back to the litany of shortcomings in equipment that I heard during the hon. member's speech.  
The reality is that the places that are housing and caring for all the displaced people right now, Albania, Bosnia, Turkey and Croatia, all these places with hundreds of thousands of displaced people do not have a lot of resources either. 
Indeed they have so few resources that the large volume of refugees in their areas could potentially destabilize their countries.  
I want to ask the hon. member opposite what his view would be on Canada's participation, maybe not today but in the near future, after this goes, to help the economies of those countries facing this crisis that is thrust upon them right now. 
What would his view be on making the humanitarian effort on the ground? 
That is the debate today. 
It is not a debate on helicopters and equipment- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but I have to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead, a short response.  
Mr. David Price:
Mr. Speaker, I would quickly answer by asking about the minister's supposed trip to the security council. 
If he did go, I am wondering why he has not made a report to the foreign affairs committee to explain exactly what he has done there to try to help the situation.  
On the other side, what is important here is it is strange that last week the government offered $100 million to help out the refugees and now all of a sudden, it is reneging on the deal. 
That is where we could be helping out. 
Those refugees need help. 
That money could be spent over there. 
Now is when they need it, not later on. 
These people are dying now. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to split my time with my hon. colleague from Scarborough Centre.  
A lot of the members today came here with prepared speeches. 
A lot of the members came here today pretending that they know the history of Bosnia. 
Well, to my hon. colleagues who pretend that they know the history of Bosnia, to my hon. colleagues who have travelled to Yugoslavia and to Kosovo and who say they know the Balkan history, I say to them that they have another think coming.  
Since history has been recorded, that part of the world has had atrocities done on both sides by all kinds of people. 
The atrocities happening there have been by both sides. 
It is not something new.  
I can quote text and verse from 50 years ago, from 100 years ago, from 200 years ago, the history of what has happened in that part of the world. 
It was the Ottoman empire. 
Before that there was the Byzantine empire. 
Before that was the Roman empire.  
For my hon. colleagues who say that they know about Balkan history because they have visited Bosnia, I say go read the history and do not be ignorant.  
I want to share a couple of e-mails I received from people who are in the midst of this turmoil.  
A lady from Kitchener wrote ``If we, Canada, send in ground troops to attack Yugoslavia, does that mean we are going to declare war on Yugoslavia? 
If yes, are the Canadian born Serbs and Serb immigrants going to be arrested as enemies and threats to Canadian security? 
I am asking this because this happened to Germans and Japanese during World War I and World War II''.  
A lot of the people whom I have met from that part of the world say if they walk down the street and say that they are Serbian, people throw bad remarks at them.  
Somebody from Quebec wrote ``I believe that Canada should build a safe world, creating world peace, security and a prosperous world for our children and to secure international order, to protect international law and the role of the UN''.  
Somebody from New York City wrote to me. 
He said ``Since missiles do not choose their victims, children, young and old people have been killed''. 
A civilian train was bombed off its rails today. 
Last night there was the killing of nine and injuring of 17.  
I will continue with another individual who wrote to say that both sides have refugees. 
It is not only on one side, but there are also the refugees from Yugoslavia who are in Hungary right now. 
He quotes ``She came to Budapest with her children about 12 days ago. 
She was paying for their shelter, as many other Yugoslavs''.  
I want to continue with a letter I received from a constituent who told me he came from Russia and that he was proud to be a Canadian. 
He wrote that the day he became a Canadian citizen was one of the most remembered days in his life. 
He said he could not recall a single occasion, prior to this event, when his answer, ``I am from Canada'', would not bring a friendly smile on the face of any airport clerk or fellow traveller through all eastern and western Europe. 
He said his feeling of becoming a Canadian citizen, a full member of a peaceful, tolerant and wise society respected all around the world, was overwhelming.  
He closed his letter by saying ``In the name of our future, the future of Canada and the future of the world, I beg you to stop this madness''.  
I will continue on with an E-mail I received from another constituent. 
He tells me that as a Serbian Canadian he is deeply concerned over the recent action of the government against Yugoslavia. 
He feels that not only was this action taken in contravention of international law thereby setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching consequences of international relations, but it is also in deep contradiction with Canada's allotted role as a peace loving and peacekeeping nation.  
I have a letter from another constituent who says that we do not need anybody's human losses. 
She wants us to help the refugees, the Serbians and Albanians, and to bring peace politically.  
That part of the world is in turmoil. 
NATO acted because NATO thought it had to act. 
NATO disrespected acting in previous times. 
NATO did not act when the island of Cyprus was invaded. 
NATO did nothing. 
It sat on its chair when genocide was happening in Rwanda. 
It does nothing today in Kurdistan, in that eastern part of Turkey where people are being prosecuted just as badly.  
I have about 6,000 Tamils in my riding. 
They sent me a copy of a letter that went to the Minister of Foreign Affairs from the Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils. 
They write in the letter that the civil war in Sri Lanka not only predates the Kosovo conflict by more than a decade, but also has claimed many more lives, more than 75,000. 
They say that just like the Albanians fleeing the Serbian onslaught, over 700 Tamils fled when the Sinhalese army, after a bloody military campaign, occupied the Jaffna peninsula.  
They close their letter by saying that they are not asking the hon. minister to bomb or use military force against the Sri Lankan racist government as in the case of Yugoslavia. 
They are simply asking the hon. minister to exert pressure on the Sri Lankan government to withdraw the Sinhalese armed forces from the Tamil homeland and seek a political solution to the ethnic conflict.  
Both groups on both sides are making comments. 
Both groups on both sides believe they are right. 
We are supposedly bombing military targets, but there is overwhelming evidence that this is not the case. 
One has to ask why we are there. 
Are we there because we have a particular interest or are we there because we are the world policemen? 
If we are the world policemen, will we continue tomorrow, or is this a one time event? 
Will we go on from here? 
Will we go into Sri Lanka? 
Will we ask the government of Turkey to stop oppressing the people of Kurdistan, its own province? 
Will we ask all oppressing governments to do this or did we just choose to go to Yugoslavia because of different reasons?  
Last week I had the opportunity of meeting with people.  
Last week I received 15,000 signatures on a petition from a community in Toronto. 
We do not want to see the residents of Kosovo live in peace and harmony''.  
I am not saying that the policy of bombing military installations is right or wrong. 
I am supportive of our troops over there. 
However, when we get reports that civilians have been hurt it brings to mind a view that yes, we might be at war but are we doing the right thing. 
I will support whatever action is needed in order to bring peace to the world. 
I will support whatever action is needed to make sure that our children, and God bless us all, live in peace.  
To those men and women who are serving over there, as the Government of Canada has asked them to do, I applaud and support them. 
I say to them, ``when you do you work, please make sure you do not kill innocent people''.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have received confirmation from the office of the Minister of National Defence that the U.S. does in fact use depleted uranium in their chain gun on their A-10s.  
I want to read a quote by Sara Flounders, co-director of the International Action Centre and a contributing author of a book entitled Medal of Dishonor:
She states, ``The use of A-10 Warthogs with DU shells threaten to make a nuclear wasteland of Kosovo. 
The Pentagon is laying waste the very people along with their children that they claim to be saving. 
This is another reason for fighting to end the attack on Yugoslavia''.  
Does the hon. member have any concerns about the fact that depleted uranium is being used on the weapons that are currently being deployed in Kosovo?  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis:
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for bringing that to the attention of the House. 
I have read about this in approximately 30 e-mails that have come to me. 
I seem to be the focus for e-mails and have received over 8,000 in the last week or so. 
I can only confirm that statement by what I read from a university professor in the European city of Saloniki in Greece. 
He said that this will not only have an effect in Kosovo and in Serbia but it will also spread into FYROM and to Greece. 
I am really concerned with the situation.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
We should put that aside because it is a red herring in this debate.  
I listened very carefully to the member's speech and I appreciated everything he said. 
Does he see any parallels, any relationships, between what is happening to the Albanians in Kosovo to what happened to the Armenians in 1915 as a result of Turkey and the first world war?  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis:
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for his particular question. 
I would give him the following answer. 
If NATO or a similar organization had existed at that time I wish it had acted. 
However, there was an organization that did go in to help. 
The only thing it did was uproot the people and drive them out of their homes. 
It caused the Ottoman Empire to inflict more harm on the people than it would have done. 
Maybe what NATO is doing today is similar to that time.  
We have seen how many refugees were coming out of Kosovo before NATO struck. 
After NATO struck, the number of refugees coming out jumped and quadrupled. 
After watching television last night and seeing refugees in FYROM, the former Yugoslavian Macedonian Republic, behind barbed wire, it brought haunting images back to my mind of when I visited Dachau in Munich at the age of five.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my colleague from Scarborough-Agincourt for sharing his time with me.  
Today as I stand to participate in this debate let me just say from the outset that it is a very sad moment. 
When we, as representatives, go to the people during campaigns, we go to the people promising to improve our society, improve our nation, take care of the deficit, create jobs and improve the future for our children. 
We often say, for example, that our youth is our future. 
If we indeed believe in that then today I say with great sadness that we are killing that future whether it is here in Canada or somewhere in Europe, in Serbia or in Kosovo.  
I want to participate in the debate by going through some of the events that have occurred over the past couple of months in the House and in committee.  
In a joint session not too long ago of the Senate and the House of Commons, we had representatives from the United States, specifically Mr. Robert McNamara, former U.S. defense secretary; General Lee Butler, former commander in chief of the U.S. defense; and Dr. Thomas Graham, Director of International Security Programs, Rockefeller Foundation.  
They wished they could have known then what they know today when they were spearheading the U.S. activity and effort in Vietnam. 
They came to Canada today to applaud us on our initiative and our report in terms of ridding society of all the nuclear warheads that are out there.  
I hate to see what people like General Wesley Clark and others are going to say maybe 20 years down the road. 
It was sad when my colleague mentioned seeing the barbed wire that I also saw. 
It brought back images of some documentaries I saw about the holocaust. 
I said that this was another holocaust happening. 
There were people in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia having cellular phones passed over to them so they could get in touch with their relatives to see if indeed their lives could improve.  
I told Mr. Aragona in the foreign affairs committee a little while ago that being in Europe was their responsibility. 
My colleague from Scarborough-Agincourt touched on the fact that unless one knows the people, the history, the diversity and what happened 200 or 300 years ago, it is difficult to address the problem. 
I refer to 1994 when the military came before a joint committee to give us an update of what was happening in the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  
What did our military say? 
It said it was not sure if the Croats were killing the Croats and blaming it on the other guys, or if the Serbs were killing the Serbs and blaming it on the other guys, or if the Muslims were killing the Muslims and blaming it on the other guys. 
I am upset that unfortunately these atrocities are happening today. 
My colleague touched upon the early 1900s and how sad it was the way we started this century. 
Earlier another colleague talked about the middle of the century and the genocide of the Jews, sadly. 
Here we are about to close the century with what? 
More genocide and more ethnic cleansing. 
What a shame to all of us who live on the planet including me.  
We talked about Rwanda. 
I want to take this opportunity to show the leadership taken by this country and this Prime Minister. 
He did not hesitate for a moment. 
He took the bull by the horns to address that horrible situation. 
Later they said they should have done more. 
It was as Mr. MacNamara and General Lee Butler said: ``Gee, we erred back in Vietnam''.  
Earlier my colleague from the Conservative Party said that there must be war and I asked him why. 
There is a political solution. 
If the will is there we can find a solution.  
As I suggested earlier and will suggest now, I firmly believe that the United States has to work to bring the Russians to the table. 
They can provide leadership, given the alliances and relationships with the Serbian people historically. 
It is an opportunity now. 
I heard the Serbian deputy prime minister on television not too long ago say ``Please stop the bombing; we want to talk''. 
Why are we not calling them out on that? 
Maybe he is misleading us all. 
Who knows? 
Given the loss of life on both sides, why do we not bring them to the table to see what their intentions are? 
If they are prepared to deal in good faith then let us advance it in a positive way. 
If they are not and they renege then I believe we should consolidate with the Europeans and all the Balkan regions.  
I am glad my colleague from Hamilton put me at ease. 
When I heard about the uranium I was concerned, not because of the people in Serbia but because of the people in Italy, France, Greece, Albania and all over that region.  
When Mr. Aragona, head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, was before the foreign affairs committee, I asked him a few questions which I will repeat in the House. 
By moving in as aggressively as we are, I believe we are setting a very dangerous precedent. 
We know there are other hot spots around the globe today. 
We see what is happening with the Basque region. 
We see what is happening in northern Italy with the separatist movement. 
We see what is happening in Corsica. 
I heard on the news that up until about eight months ago the CIA had the KLA on a terrorist list. 
Maybe it has changed. 
Maybe it has been baptised. 
I hope it has but I do not know.  
Let us try to hypothesize. 
What happens if bombs go off in Corsica or in the Basque region and innocent people are killed? 
Does that mean that NATO will suddenly move in and bomb these people? 
I hope not.  
We are setting a dangerous precedent. 
NATO is showing today that it is not listening. 
When it was trying to sort out an agreement in France all I heard was Madeleine Albright saying ``We are going to bomb''. 
Who is ``we''? 
Is it the United States or NATO? 
Why was Mr. Solana not the spokesperson on behalf of NATO? 
With the Americans it seems to be Dodge City and Gunsmoke all over again: shoot first and ask questions later.  
As the Prime Minister said earlier today, not to choose is wrong. 
We must choose. 
We as Canadians have set an example, historically speaking. 
We have a reputation, as a colleague from the Conservative Party said, second to none. 
We owe it today to that reputation to once again spearhead an effort to find a political solution for the benefit of all these people.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I started out by thinking that the member was for the government. 
I have a real problem. 
What the government has decided to do, and we have agreed with it, is to bomb and I believe possibly today the foreign affairs minister has agreed that if necessary we might put in ground troops. 
Does the hon. member agree or disagree with what the government will do?  
Mr. John Cannis:
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who sits with me on the foreign affairs committee knows very well where I stand on these issues.  
I merely took this opportunity to outline some of the dangers in this approach. 
NATO has decided, spearheaded by the United States initiative, to use these types of tactics. 
I am simply saying I feel that there was some room to take the agenda a bit forward.  
I do not believe that we have exhausted every possibility. 
I believe that by taking the moves we did we in essence allowed Milosevic to consolidate support. 
As the member mentioned earlier he has gained popularity unwarranted. 
When I saw earlier on television the youth from Serbia standing there as human shields and demonstrating I was sad. 
Instead of those youths holding high school, college or university in their hands, they are holding up target images. 
I think mothers and fathers should be busy providing for households.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the very passionate remarks of the member opposite. 
Have we done everything at the security council to get this message across? 
Have we pursued every diplomatic end before taking these steps and participating in bombing missions that are going on as we speak?  
All Canadians and all members of the House have seen the graphic pictures, the graphic images of which he spoke of children and the mass exodus of people being herded from their country and their ancient homes like sheep. 
I am sure those images conger up very passionate feelings not only in the member opposite but in all members.  
Has the Minister of Foreign Affairs pursued every possible angle? 
Has the member opposite relayed those feelings to him directly?  
Mr. John Cannis:
Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding from what I have heard and in briefings that the minister is doing everything within his power, within his means, and with whatever is available to him to make sure the Canadian message gets through.  
The foreign affairs minister and the minister of defence are trying everything possible to achieve a peaceful resolution of this unfortunate conflict.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party member asked our Liberal colleague an excellent question.  
Since Canada decided, in a show of unity, to support the objectives pursued by NATO, should the allies decide to send ground troops, would the Canadian government endorse NATO's decision to immediately send 200,000 troops to Kosovo, yes or no?  
Mr. John Cannis:
Mr. Speaker, as I said to the member from the Conservative Party, we are undertaking every initiative to resolve the issue before we even get to that stage.  
They are always planning in advance what their next step will be. 
Today the military and the political arena are planning. 
What will happen tomorrow or a week or two down the road only God knows. 
Right now we are hoping for a peaceful resolution.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, late last month the House was informed by the foreign affairs minister and the defence minister that Canadian forces aircraft were involved in the operation in Kosovo. 
We really wonder who actually listens to take not debates.  
The interest of this great country demanded that I put aside all the reservations I might have had about that air involvement, and my party and I supported it. 
Three weeks later here we are again discussing a possible commitment of Canadian forces without a votable motion.  
I express my profound disappointment at the government's refusal yet again to take the high road and bring forth a motion to allow parliament to sit in committee of the whole and listen to expert witnesses, then allow parliament to debate that issue and finally end with a vote. 
That is what democracy is all about. 
That is what the Canadian people deserve when it comes to an issue of war. 
I am insulted and Canadians across the country should be outraged at the government's failure to respect simple democratic principles. 
As of March 24 I supported the current mission. 
Having said that I too believe that the only resolution for the many problems of the Balkans is through negotiation. 
I concur with so much that has been said in the House this evening and this afternoon that involvement of the Russians is critical in settling the issue. 
Often in history one must go back to diplomacy, but usually one finds that diplomacy must be backed up with military power.  
Once NATO committed itself to the solution of the Kosovar civil war and once it got into the Rambouillet peace talks, its credibility was put on the line. 
President Milosevic underestimated the resolve of the western alliance. 
As each day passes he increasingly desires a way out of the current confrontation with NATO. 
We will eventually be able to negotiate a settlement by keeping the pressure on. 
The best hope for long term peace in the region is to stay the course.  
We should continue with air strikes to degrade the Yugoslavian military capabilities. 
Reports today say that is in fact happening, that it is running short of fuel, that it is running short of ammunition. 
That is good news for all of us and for the people of Kosovo.  
To convince Belgrade of the wisdom of negotiation will be the diplomacy that is involved. 
Milosevic must be convinced that there is a real opportunity to negotiate and that he must be sincere if he returns to the negotiation table.  
Canadians clearly want something to be done. 
The images of ethnic cleansing demand a response, but Canadians are also aware of the limitations of military capability.  
There are many issues that the government and NATO need to address. 
I want to know what the actual objectives of such a campaign are and what the likely exit strategy would be if we were to go in with ground forces. 
I want to have some idea of the resistance the military is expected to face. 
I want to have a complete briefing on the potential casualties that we might suffer. 
I also want a strongly worded, sincere and public assurance that the Canadian forces are adequately equipped to do the job.  
The auditor general and military experts have repeatedly pointed out the serious equipment problems faced by our land forces. 
These issues should be seriously and honestly addressed by both the defence minister and the chief of defence staff.  
We are proud of our troops. 
We are proud of what they do, but I too, like some others in the House, have seen them in operation and feel sorry for them as they try to do their job with equipment that is less than adequate.  
Most important of all, I want the government to clarify why we are in Kosovo. 
Why have we chosen Kosovo when there are 30 other places where ethnic cleansing is occurring?  
I want to be able to look the Canadian people in the eye and say with total sincerity that I thought Canada's vital interests were best served by engaging in a ground war. 
I want to be able to tell Canadians that if some of their sons and daughters do not come back from such a mission the sacrifice was worthwhile.  
To date I do not have answers to any of these questions. 
The government has not made a case for such an effort. 
It is the government's job to make such a case. 
From the Prime Minister on down the government seems indifferent and fails to deal with these very serious considerations.  
The entire Kosovo effort is also somewhat unsettling in another perspective. 
In 1949 the country took an active role in creating the North Atlantic Alliance. 
At the end of this month we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of that alliance, but it is unclear to me exactly what we will be celebrating in less than three weeks' time.  
The NATO engagement in operations over Yugoslavia does not seem to be the defensive alliance that we helped to create in 1949. 
Throughout the cold war the issues were admittedly much easier to understand. 
Things are not as clear in the post cold war era and nowhere is that perhaps more confusing than in the Balkans. 
Therefore, we should be hesitant about jumping too quickly into conflicts that are so very complex.  
I am also concerned that NATO's actions today are damaging our long term relations with Russia. 
We cannot construct a new security order in Europe without the participation of a friendly and satisfied Russia. 
Russian involvement will allow Mr. Milosevic to allow an international force in Kosovo. 
Russian involvement will allow NATO to stop bombing and to say that the problem has been solved and an international force can take over.  
I see Russia's involvement as being critical in this whole issue. 
It seems clear that NATO's actions are not perceived as being defensive by Moscow. 
In fact, they are seen as being very threatening.  
We can dismiss as posturing much of the rhetoric now coming from Moscow. 
However, we must also look to the future and the day when Russia is much stronger. 
It will remember the disregard to its views that we are showing today.  
The principal questions still remain unanswered. 
What is NATO becoming? 
Is it being transformed, first by the peace support operation in Bosnia and now by its mission in Kosovo?  
The 1991 strategic concept declares explicitly: 
I do not think that anyone in this House today would argue that the civil war in Kosovo directly threatened any NATO member. 
If we accept the need to engage in this type of peacemaking, peace enforcement or humanitarian mission, where do we draw the line? 
In what region or in what conflict will we not intervene? 
What will be the priority list that we set?  
I have a list of over 30 countries that have recently experienced ethnic cleansing in one form or another. 
We have turned a blind eye to almost all of them. 
In Chechnya nearly 100,000 people were killed. 
Should NATO have responded? 
In Sudan a war has been raging for 43 years and over one million people have been killed. 
Should NATO have responded? 
This past weekend in East Timor scores of people died. 
Should NATO have been involved?  
We cannot expect that NATO should try to solve all of the problems of the world. 
We really need to know what the limits of NATO's activities will be. 
I do not believe that Canadians want to support an alliance that repeatedly finds itself mired in local and regional conflicts. 
That is not the NATO we joined in 1949. 
I do not believe that such an alliance is sustainable in the long term. 
In my opinion we just do not have the human or economic resources to sustain such an effort.  
Let me be perfectly clear. 
It is in Canada's vital interest to have a strong North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, but that alliance will only be seen to be legitimate if it is defensive. 
I do not see our people supporting NATO as a global policeman. 
As NATO intervenes it risks becoming a part of the problem.  
The situation in Kosovo is a case in point. 
By linking NATO credibility to the peace settlement in Kosovo we have become a combatant in a regional conflict. 
It is a conflict the complexity of which I am not convinced the Liberal government fully understands.  
One can only begin to understand the issue by becoming familiar with the history of the area. 
I am not at all certain that this is being done. 
Today we are being overwhelmed by images of Serbian atrocities in Kosovo, but these atrocities have occurred on all sides. 
We are angered and disgusted when we see these things, but we have to understand that this is nationalism, that it is 1,500 years old, that it is part of something much bigger than what we see simply on the surface. 
We seem to be creating a NATO protectorate and that may not be in the best interests of regional stability or in NATO's best interests. 
A protectorate over Kosovo might demand that we remain there for a long time.  
Even if we resolve the current war, I feel that there are long term problems that we should be discussing. 
The question of the ethnic Albanian population in the southern Balkans is one we will likely have to confront in the future. 
The highest birth rate in any part of the world is in that area.  
Given that this war has likely raised national consciousness, can we really expect that the ethnic Albanians will not one day want to live together in a single state? 
That aim will pose a serious challenge for existing borders. 
If this were to happen Kosovo would only be a small part of what would become a very major problem. 
The issue would embrace not only Kosovo, but Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and so on.  
I mention these issues only to show how incredibly interconnected ethnicity, politics and geography are in the southern Balkans. 
When I was there I visited nine classrooms. 
I visited bars, hospitals and restaurants. 
I talked to the people. 
Only then did I understand just how complex this problem really is.  
I have raised all of these questions for two purposes. 
First, I want the Canadian people to know what I believe the Kosovo crisis really involves. 
There is the humanitarian dimension of trying to end the ethnic cleansing in that province, something we are all disgusted with, and of seeking a solution to the long simmering ethnic problems in the region. 
However, the stakes of our involvement are far broader. 
It is also about the very purpose of NATO itself in the post-cold war period.  
It wants a blank cheque to cover its own failings. 
The government does not wish to talk about these issues because it knows that Canada no longer has as much influence in the world as it once had. 
Soft power has alienated us from our NATO allies who no longer think of us as serious international actors.  
Thirty years of disregard and disdain for the armed forces has left us without a credible voice at NATO military headquarters. 
I have learned these facts by talking to Canadians, academics and many foreign officials.  
It is true that we still sit on the North Atlantic Council since all members do, but our words just do not carry the weight they once did. 
Our opinions are no longer as respected as they once were. 
The legacy of effective Canadian diplomacy which led to NATO's creation has been squandered by governments in the last 50 years. 
We are now marginalized. 
It is often remarked that crisis focuses the mind. 
I hope that the ongoing crisis over Kosovo has that effect on all members and all parties in this House. 
The stakes involved are very great, be they the lives of Canadian forces personnel or the vital interests of this country. 
It is for this House to calmly and deliberately contemplate the consequences of the actions now being discussed. 
We must remember that each one of us as members of parliament might have to stand in front of parents or grandparents who will ask ``What did my son or daughter die for in the mud in Kosovo?''  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the hon. member is twofold. 
At the end of his speech he asked the terrible question of how we will explain our fellow citizens being put in harm's way by being engaged in the present air operation or in some future operation. 
I thought that his leader gave the answer to that question very clearly in the House this afternoon in his speech. 
We are there because of a moral imperative to be there. 
I thought his leader put that very well. 
Is the member distancing himself from his leader on the issue?  
A second question comes to mind. 
I know the member is committed to NATO, but he is very knowledgeable about foreign affairs. 
He knows full well that NATO's mandate does not run to Chechnya, Africa or Indonesia. 
Does he not fear that by raising these sorts of fears in the minds of the Canadian public that he is doing exactly what he says nobody should be doing, which is putting in doubt the credibility of NATO, which as he knows is committed to an operation in Europe and Europe alone? 
Far-fetched examples from around the globe will only distract people from a true understanding of what we are trying to achieve in this debate.  
Mr. Bob Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of NATO. 
However, I believe that when NATO's mandate has gone beyond the security mandate of defence, it is only right to ask these questions. 
The parliaments of Britain and Australia, and the U.S. congress and senate are openly debating this issue about sending men and women into harm's way.  
It seems like the Prime Minister says we are un-Canadian if we dare challenge anything the Liberal government does. 
Fortunately I am in a party where I can say I think we need to have answers before we commit our troops. 
Other members would say that we should commit them, that we have all the answers we need.  
However we should raise those questions. 
When I have to face parents or grandparents I want to be able to say I asked all of the questions before I gave a blank cheque.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to make a comment and then ask a brief question of the member for Red Deer who gave an excellent speech on the history of the whole Balkan area and the nature of the many hundreds of years of conflict and hatred which has existed in that area and seems to flourish for some strange reason.  
This whole undertaking could have probably been best done under the United Nations, but we must look at the United Nations and the ineffective way it conducts its mandate to try to keep peace in the world.  
Like the hon. member I asked many of the same questions during discussions in our caucus. 
I too am very concerned about Canadian soldiers and Canadian personnel being involved in a conflict where there may be no apparent solution, or if there is one it will not last for very long.  
I ask all those questions and I come up with the answers. 
I have to say to the hon. member that I would not want to have lived during 1939 to 1945 when the world sat on its hands for a long period of time and watched what happened with the Nazis, Hitler and the Holocaust.  
I have come to the conclusion that even with the ineffectiveness of the UN somebody had to step in. 
NATO seems to be the only body willing and able to do it. 
Did the hon. member not come to the same conclusion? 
When nobody else will step in to keep the peace in the world, does NATO not have the obligation to do it?  
Mr. Bob Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I agree with a lot of those things. 
I am extremely upset that the UN has declined to the point it is at today where it is ineffective and unable because of bureaucracy, because of the veto and so on to deal with any world issues. 
We could go back to Rwanda and so on where it failed to react.  
I did come to the conclusion that air strikes were a way to drive Mr. Milosevic to the table. 
I still hold that feeling. 
We supported that and continue to support that.  
However there may well be another step. 
That is the step that should be openly debated. 
All of the facts should be put forward. 
There should then be an opportunity for members to vote on whether or not to do that. 
Then they will be able to accomplish that face to face I described at the end of my speech.  
Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate it if the hon. member who just spoke could inform the House and, consequently, the public, as there seems to be a communication problem.  
People who are watching us at home have a right to be informed. 
They heard about the possibility of a world conflict. 
Could the hon. member inform the House, because he told us he was opposed to sending in ground troops? 
Could he tell us if the 18 days of air strikes have shaken Kosovo enough to make it possible to negotiate and avoid having to send in ground troops?  
Having sent planes in for 18, 19 or 20 days, we look a bit ridiculous. 
It is vital that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of National Defence, or NATO inform the public, at least the Canadian public, so that we know what we are up against. 
What will become of the refugees?  
In the course of numerous conflicts, Canada's role has been primarily that of a peacekeeper.  
Canada's role in the war in Kosovo is a far cry from putting up tents and distributing bread to the hungry. 
The F-18s have been brought out and now there is talk of even more advanced weaponry. 
I would like the member to inform the House and therefore the public, which is undoubtedly listening to this debate in the hope of being better informed.  
Does the member think that Kosovo has been sufficiently rattled by the 18 to 20 days of combat to bring President Milosevic back to the negotiating table in the very near future, or is a ground war inevitable?  
Mr. Bob Mills:
Mr. Speaker, this brings up a very important point. 
I think the member asked three things. 
I believe people are not well informed about the Balkans. 
I must admit it has taken me six years of concentrated effort and a lot of talking with ambassadors from the various areas and the people involved, including the Russian ambassador, to understand the complexity of the issue.  
We owe the Canadian public this information. 
That is why the House should be full with 301 members and why we should have a debate. 
A take note debate should be an information session. 
Do I think the 18 days of bombing have had an effect? 
I believe it is starting to. 
Tomorrow the G-8 is conducting negotiations. 
The G-8, with Russia as a member, is involved. 
The OSCE with 55 countries is also in full negotiation. 
Russia is a member of that. 
I believe getting Russia into that international peace force will allow both sides to step back and let negotiation work. 
The combination of bombing and that can probably stop this thing. 
That is how I see it happening.  
Do I know that it will work? 
Obviously not, but at least there is a plan that I can understand. 
The meetings of the G-8 tomorrow in Bonn are extremely important. 
They might put on additional pressure. 
It will not be a NATO mission any more, which would make me happy. 
The hon. member also asked about refugees. 
Obviously Canada has a role in that regard as well. 
For a long time we have accepted true refugees. 
At this point the main thing we should do in this crisis situation is make sure they are well taken care of where they are, as best we can deliver. 
There are now 80 flights a day into Macedonia and 60 flights a day into Albania carrying relief effort. 
That has solved the problem literally in the very short term.  
I believe we are taking care of that. 
NATO is doing a great job in that area. 
Ultimately let us find out who wants to go back and who wants to become a refugee. 
Then we will solve that problem in due course.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Laval West.  
I listened with great interest to the debate so far and I do not wish to repeat that which many hon. members have said in the House. 
It is clear from what I have listened to in the debate that most of our colleagues are in favour of the government's action and of NATO's action as it presently takes place. 
Some have even made it clear that they would support further action, including ground troops under certain circumstances if our humanitarian aim to return the people of Kosovo to their homes is not met.  
All hon. members of the House recognize that our action raises difficult issues. 
The hon. member for Red Deer just referred to some of them. 
The hon. member for Scarborough-Agincourt also referred to some of them.  
The issue of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia in traditional international law terms and in traditional diplomatic terms is a very serious issue that we must consider. 
The future of the United Nations system given NATO's role without specific UN security council sanction raises issues in itself which require serious consideration in the House.  
Finally, among many other issues is the suffering of many innocent people in Yugoslavia. 
We must recognize that in seeking to stop the government of Mr. Milosevic and his war making machine others are paying the price.  
All of us have many constituents with families asking us to bring an end to the situation. 
Those same constituents also recognize that ultimately the solution to this issue, the solution to the problem in the Balkans, will be the restoration of democracy in Yugoslavia, the restoration of an open, tolerant and pluralistic society in that area. 
That is how we got where we are by virtue of the existence of a dictatorship which did not stumble into the issue.  
The member for Red Deer raised issues of the complexities of life in the Balkans. 
Members will recall that Bismarck said in 1888 ``If another war occurs in Europe it will be because of some silly thing in the Balkans''. 
We are still wrestling with the complexities of the ending of the Turkish empire, the whole issue of the complexities of relationships of peoples in the Balkans. 
When we look at this issue we know that it was planned by one mastermind. 
It was planned by the government of Mr. Milosevic.  
Recent evidence is showing that military leaders who were opposed to him were dismissed, that troops were put in with the specific issue of conducting ethnic cleansing, and that this would have gone on if we had done nothing and sat there. 
We were therefore forced to face this awful choice.  
Would we sit there and do nothing as the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry said in the debate earlier this afternoon, or, as another member just said, what about the analogy of 1939? 
Would we sit there and do nothing, let it happen and run the certainty that there would have been over a million refugees in Macedonia and in other countries in the region, threatening the security of Europe for the next how many years?  
How long would these million or million and a half people live in squalor and in refugee camps? 
Have we not seen the refugee camps in Palestine? 
Have we not seen refugee camps in other places where whole generations of people have grown up as refugees outside their countries? 
Could we in all honesty tolerate that situation to happen again if we had an opportunity to deal with it?  
As the member for Red Deer's leader said this afternoon, did we not have a moral imperative to deal with it? 
Did we not have a right or a duty to say yes, this creates a difficult precedent? 
Yes, it raises difficult issues of sovereignty. 
Do we not have an obligation to ask ourselves whether we are living in a changed world, a world in which we have learned the lessons of failure to intervene in grave cases such was Rwanda or even the second world war?  
Are we not living in a new world where humanitarian rules and humanitarian considerations prevail, rules that are being evolved by the international criminal court, by the Pinochet case and by other precedents which are telling us that national sovereignty is not what it used to be, that leaders can no longer in their own countries treat their population the way they wish and be able to get away with it because of a 19th century doctrine of national sovereignty?  
We must deal with this because we are obliged to. 
Our peace and security are threatened when we see such situations developing with the terrible humanitarian consequences of millions of displaced people being pushed out of a country because of the iron will of one government and one man.  
That is why the Prime Minister and the leaders of all other parties were of the view today that we must continue with this until there is a solution. 
That solution is that the Kosovars must go home. 
That is the moral imperative of which the leader of the Reform Party spoke this afternoon. 
That is the answer to the objections that the member for Red Deer has raised in the House this evening.  
When members have said use ground troops if necessary that is what they are trying to deal with, recognizing that if that comes there would be an important role for a possible Russian contingent in such a force. 
This would be difficult but Russia's present prime minister, Mr. Primakov, is a very able and skilful diplomat. 
He may yet be able to bring some helpful resolution to this horrible problem.  
I want to raise two other issues which I do not think have been considered in any great detail in the House today.  
The first is that of Montenegro. 
We owe it to ourselves and to the people of Montenegro and their courageous president, Milo Djukanovic who has managed to keep his people out of this conflict, to ensure that we and our NATO allies do nothing that would push his people into a war situation. 
He has so skilfully and ably resisted the terrible pulls in that region and has saved his people from the scourge of this conflict. 
I hope that our NATO allies and our government are doing everything to ensure that peace will reign in that one small area of sanity that still prevails in that region.  
Second, I hope that we will turn our minds to the issue of what will happen after. 
The leader of the New Democratic Party raised this in the House this afternoon. 
I support her position.  
We have to be in a position to consider rebuilding the society after this is over. 
To intervene today and leave a totally destroyed society would be irresponsible. 
We cannot do that. 
We are now engaged, it seems to me, in a situation to ensure that Kosovars return to their homes, but they must return to homes. 
We will have to make sure that when this is over we will be engaged in a process to enable them to return to a real society that we help build together.  
We also must make sure in Serbia itself, in Belgrade that the citizens know that when Mr. Milosevic goes, and he will eventually go at some time, and a new, open and liberal society is developed in that country, we will be there to help rebuild. 
Otherwise all we have done up to now will have been a total waste of time.  
I ask members of the House that when we are calling for action today, let us not forget the humanitarian aid we are looking at. 
Humanitarian aid will have to extend well beyond that of helping refugees in their place. 
Humanitarian aid will have to go in the long term to rebuilding a society, to rebuilding democratic institutions and an infrastructure that will enable reasonable life to return to that area. 
Only if we look at this long view, only if we deal not only with the present crisis, but recognize the root causes of it, will we be able to avoid the problems that have led us here.  
Only if we follow the road of recognizing that there is a new society with a new rule of law applicable to the Pinochets, the Rwandans, the Milosevics and others will we be able to assure ourselves that this will not reoccur and we will not be debating this issue at another time in the House in other circumstances.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member on his presentation. 
It was a very good one and very well thought out as well.  
I want to make a comment and ask him a question. 
It is regrettable that we did not get the chance to debate this matter before our air force was committed to military action. 
The bottom line now is that we are embroiled in a military conflict overseas. 
I am sure he is aware that many military experts feel that this will inevitably lead to the involvement of ground troops. 
Polling seems to indicate that a majority of the Canadian public currently support the government's position on this particular issue.  
I wonder if the hon. member would comment on whether in his opinion that government support will hold if we get into an all out war in the hills and mountains of Kosovo, a war that would inevitably lead to casualties on both sides.  
Mr. Bill Graham:
The member will recall that we had a debate in the House in February around the issue of the Rambouillet accords.  
As I recall, at that time it was understood in the debate that if the Rambouillet accords were not adhered to, Mr. Milosevic would have to recognize that air action would be taken. 
My recollection was that we and the members of the House believed that was necessary to bring Mr. Milosevic to that position.  
If we are to discuss it, then let us make it clear it would only be done in circumstances where we would be assured that militarily the operation would be with the best possible assurance that the casualties would be minimal. 
We cannot ever go into a ground action and say there will be no casualties. 
That would be irresponsible. 
But we can certainly make sure that it is planned and directed in a way in which those would be an absolute minimum. 
That would require a great deal of planning, a great many ground forces and a lot of commitment before we got there.  
I would not by any means suggest to the member that I as a responsible member of parliament would take that obligation or that idea lightly. 
It would be an extremely complicated and very difficult step. 
Given the humanitarian considerations we are looking at, we may well end up there rather than face the alternative which would be to say to Mr. Milosevic ``You achieved what you want. 
You have a totally bombed out and destroyed society, but you have got it, you have got your piece of earth and others will not live there''.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I often agree with the general premise the chairman of our foreign affairs committee puts forward and certainly the last one regarding the rebuilding that will be necessary.  
The problem is dollars and the commitment of any government anywhere in the world to 30 to 50 years of rebuilding. 
Does the member really believe we can assure the people of Serbia, as he mentioned, or the people of Kosovo, that we will be that committed?  
Mr. Bill Graham:
Mr. Speaker, that is certainly a very fair question. 
It is a question of dollars and I do not disagree with the member, but we also have to ask ourselves, are the dollars more? 
If we are going to allow this to happen again, if we do sort this out, is it going to be a longer term pain for a short term gain, instead of the reverse? 
We really have to look at it.  
I think the member will agree with me because he and I have travelled together to Bosnia and we have looked at this situation. 
The NATO or SFOR protectorate to call it that which exists in Bosnia is a long term operation. 
I agree with the member entirely that this would not be cheap, but the war we are otherwise going to engage in to solve it would be more expensive.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the motion regarding the human tragedy which has been happening in Kosovo.  
The situation in Kosovo and surrounding countries is desperate. 
This is a humanitarian crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes. 
Once they get to the border, they are stripped of their passports, their dignity, their heritage.  
This is one of the worst forced exodus of civilians in Europe since the end of the second world war.  
According to unconfirmed reports, there are up to 800,000 displaced Kosovars, 150,000 to 200,000 of whom are said to be without shelter. 
A large number of them are being harassed by Serb authorities, and are in a dreadful state, suffering from shock, malnutrition and hypothermia. 
We had to act, we could not stand idle before such a disaster.  
I am very proud that our government has consistently co-operated with the international community to put an end to this conflict by promoting a fair political settlement allowing refugees to go back to Kosovo without fearing for their security.  
During a crisis such as this it is important for people not to lose track of underlying causes. 
Therefore I would like to recall how the crisis started and how Canada responded to the events.  
We should bear in mind that before Mr. Milosevic rose to power, Kosovo was made up principally of ethnic Albanians and had constitutional autonomy. 
That right was stripped away by Mr. Milosevic in 1989. 
From that point forward he has deliberately implemented a plan to impoverish and oppress the Kosovars. 
Early last year his security forces mounted a campaign against innocent civilians similar to the ethnic atrocities we witnessed in both Croatia and Bosnia.  
Canada supported the systematic efforts by our allies to settle the situation diplomatically. 
Last year, two UN resolutions failed to achieve an end to the fighting in Kosovo. 
Canada would by far have preferred a diplomatic solution-we have said so and we have repeated it-as we have indicated to Mr. Milosevic, who preferred to ignore the honest warnings given.  
An agreement was reached, finally, under threat of NATO's air power. 
It established a ceasefire and provided for the intervention of an observation mission headed by the Organization on Security and Co-operation in Europe that would ensure the provisions were followed.  
In addition, the agreement provided for the imposition of strict limitations on the deployment of Yugoslav security forces, but Mr. Milosevic unfortunately did not keep his word. 
The Yugoslav forces violated the ceasefire and conducted a campaign against civilians that clearly contravened international human rights.  
The Yugoslavs increasingly defied the allies over the next four months, as the increased violence and specific incidents, such as the massacre at Racak, testified. 
Despite all, we continued all our diplomatic efforts, such as the discussions held in Rambouillet, France.  
It did not affect in any way the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. 
The agreement demanded of both parties the courage to make compromises.  
In the end the Kosovars showed the courage to sign the agreement. 
However, Mr. Milosevic was only interested in gaining precious time. 
The diplomatic track has run its course. 
Our vision and our commitment to leave no diplomatic stone unturned were once again rewarded by Mr. Milosevic's unwillingness to stand by the agreements he had made or to seek a peaceful solution. 
In fact, he continued the build up of his forces during the Rambouillet process.  
It is Mr. Milosevic and his government which bear responsibility for this human tragedy. 
Now we have been forced to turn to a measure of last resort, military force. 
This was not an easy decision nor a hasty one. 
But the interests we seek to preserve and protect in this region are significant.  
Peace and stability in Europe has always been a pillar of Canadian security policy. 
Our interest in restoring and maintaining that stability is as great today as it was in the past.  
The goal of NATO's air strikes is obvious: reduce the capacity of Yugoslavia's forces to attack the people of Kosovo. 
Kosovars themselves admit that it is not these military operations that caused the present tragedy.  
The operations seek to prevent an even worse humanitarian disaster and to prevent the instability to spread elsewhere in the region. 
We are using both diplomatic and military means to reach our goals. 
The first phase of air strikes was aimed at reducing the capacity of the very powerful air defence system of Yugoslavia and, hence, to reduce its threat to NATO's pilots. 
The day following the raids, Yugoslavia broke off its diplomatic relations with the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France.  
In response to the intensification of Yugoslavia's offensive in Kosovo, NATO decided to launch the second phase of operations, namely to attack the armed forces of Yugoslavia and reduce their capacity to harm Kosovars.  
Because of the intransigence of Mr. Milosevic, waves of refugees crossed the border into neighbouring countries. 
On April 3, some 320,000 Albanian Kosovars had already fled Kosovo or were gathering at the border in the hope of seeking refuge in Albania, in the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and in Montenegro, whose governments are more tolerant than the Serbian government, and elsewhere. 
Refugees represent an enormous challenge for those countries, which are very poor and can hardly meet their own basic needs.  
Since the beginning of April, NATO attacks have intensified, though the goal of operations remains the same, to reduce and eventually destroy the resources used by Mr. Milosevic to wage war against citizens of his own country.  
Canada has contributed effectively and with determination to these military operations. 
Our CF-18s, with their state of the art equipment, and NATO's AWAC aircraft, that are operated in part by Canadian crews, control the air space and guarantee the effectiveness of strikes, with the essential help of support personnel.  
We should not forget that, at the same time, the Canadian government is doing its share to help the affected population and has provided to date over $18 million in humanitarian help. 
Right here in Canada, when the government has announced on April 5 that it would receive 5,000 refugees, Canadians opened their hearts and started preparing their homes to welcome the Kosovars.  
Activities in Canada to support a lasting peace in that part of the world have included permanent support for the international criminal tribunal for former Yougoslavia. 
We want to make it clear that Yougoslav leaders will be held responsible for all the crimes they have committed or allowed to be committed in Kosovo. 
We will not let Mr. Milosevic's government and armed security forces to continue their action in Kosovo.  
As a loyal and effective member of NATO, Canada is striving, along with its allies, to find a solution to this conflict and to promote a fair political settlement that will allow refugees to go back in their country in safety.  
I think Canada should persevere in its efforts, and I know that Canadians share my position.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech tonight with great interest.  
One of the things that many people are concerned about in Canada and indeed around the world with respect to this present conflict is its possible escalation.  
I was very pleased earlier today to hear the Prime Minister say that he was not adverse to a truly international peacekeeping force rather than simply a NATO force, which was one of the conditions of the Rambouillet accord. 
Of course, by the very nature of the fact that the NATO force is now viewed by the Serbians as being the aggressor, I think increasingly that condition is unacceptable to Serbia; not just to Milosevic, to whom it may or may not be of concern, but it is certainly unacceptable to the Serbian people.  
I wonder as a member of the government if the hon. member could comment on what her view is with regards to Russia playing a greater role in a potential international peacekeeping force and why we continue to hear that Canada is not making any concerted effort to approach the Russians, to make any overtures toward them to try to have them involved in a much more substantive manner, in much the way that they were involved in brokering the Rambouillet accord. 
If we are going to have a negotiated settlement at some point in time, I think it is incredibly important that the Russians be involved.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his question. 
It brings up a point that I would have liked to have addressed in my earlier remarks.  
Historically Russia has been an ally of the Serb population for several centuries. 
I would certainly hope that Russia would step in. 
Russia has certainly tried to help by talking to Mr. Milosevic, but from what I understand things are at a standstill.  
I agree with the hon. member that it would be extremely useful for the Canadian government to stretch out a hand in dialogue. 
I will put it in those terms. 
Both Canada and Russia should sit down with other nations concerned, possibly the United States, to see what could be done.  
In terms of NATO, our efforts so far have been to try to weaken the Serbian military force.  
I disagree with the member that Milosevic is not an important person. 
He is key to what is going on in that part of the world.  
I think it is important for Canada to move forward in a proactive way and to reach out to Russia.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the role of the House of Commons and parliament in this debate. 
It seems that speaker after speaker from the government benches has defended the idea that the House of Commons should not be involved in this decision except to have a general discussion, but not to actually have a vote.  
Sometimes in this place we vote on the most absurd and silly things. 
However, we cannot seem to get the government to commit to a vote if we are going to have a declaration of war. 
It is my belief that that should never happen.  
I am in full agreement with the comments made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in 1990-91 regarding the Iraq war. 
At that time they said that we should not go to war, and we should not commit troops, unless we hold a vote in the House of Commons.  
I would even go so far as to say that in the Constitution of Canada there should be a provision that we cannot commit troops to a military engagement, attacking another country, unless it comes to the House of Commons first. 
No cabinet, no 30 or 40 individuals in this country, should have that kind of power.  
How can this government member not agree with me when I say that there must be full and complete disclosure, that there must be full and complete discussion in this House on the costs, the refugee problems, how many troops are going to be committed and the danger as this conflict escalates to a ground war? 
How can anyone in this House not say that we should have a vote before we commit any further to this conflict in Yugoslavia?  
Ms. Raymonde Folco:
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member answered his own question when he said, and quote: 
We should have a vote before we commit to sending ground troops into Kosovo and Serbian territory. 
I could not be more in agreement with that. 
The Prime Minister repeated time and time again today during question period that at this time there is no question of our committing any Canadian ground troops and that if there ever was any question there would be a debate in this House and a vote.  
Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in tonight's debate, but also a bit weary at having to do so, because it is always hard to address humanitarian crises that are not under control and that can lead God knows where.  
For the benefit of our fellow citizens who might not have had the opportunity to follow the daily coverage of this crisis in the papers, I think it would be useful to give an overview of the situation.  
On March 24, the very day the air campaign started, Kosovar refugees totalled 450,000 people, including 260,000 inside Kosovo. 
In only 13 days, the number of displaced persons has increased by 30,000.  
The last solution proposed by the Assembly was the international peace conference in Rambouillet, France. 
This conference ended in a peace plan which the Kosovars never signed. 
In a word, this peace plan extending over three years provided for a substantial level of autonomy for the Kosovars, but always within Yugoslavia.  
Moreover, it provided for the deployment of NATO troops to ensure the enforcement of that plan. 
It is this last element that President Milosevic rejected, foreseeing the partition of Kosovo from Serbia at the end of the three years, and occupation of his territory by a foreign force.  
It is therefore to put an end to the violence of the Serbian authorities against the Albanian population of Kosovo, which represents 80« of the total population, and to try and convince Milosevic to accept the Rambouillet accord, that NATO conducted air strikes against the Yugoslavian army.  
It is essentially for the same reasons that Canada agreed to participate to the NATO'S Allied Forces operation. 
Canada also recognized that as long as this conflict was permitted to last, it could result in major humanitarian disasters and destabilise the whole region at the same time. 
This is why Belgrade's acceptance of the Rambouillet peace plan had become essential from a Canadian standpoint.  
The Bloc Quebecois supported the NATO military intervention in Kosovo and Yugoslavia because it felt and indeed, like all the NATO countries, still thinks that it is better to try to do something in Kosovo than to let a situation that has been going on for 10 years continue to deteriorate.  
But time is a very significant and legitimate time factor with respect to the air strikes in Yugoslavia. 
I questioned the Minister of National Defence about it in this House, but he did not answer. 
Do NATO countries all agree to keep bombing Yugoslavia much longer before considering other options?  
Mr. Speaker, members are presently having a private conversation near me and that bothers me. 
Would you please ask them to tone it down a little or to take their conversation somewhere else.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask hon. members to please be a little more quiet.  
Mr. René Laurin:
As I was saying, while NATO pursues its air strikes, the exodus is continuing. 
The massacres are continuing and the ethnic cleansing started a long time ago is intensifying. 
If our goal is to stop the dreaded genocide, the crimes against humanity and the exodus, we must ask ourselves if all of this will not be a fait accompli in a few weeks. 
If, for the time being, Russia's opposition remains mainly rhetorical, who is to say that, in a few weeks, this opposition will not take a more active form, such as the sending of military equipment or countering NATO action?  
If NATO members are really committed to solve the problem in Kosovo and to make sure refugees return to their homes, they must set a deadline which, if crossed, will entail other military or political action, including ground troops.  
While his military storage sites are being bombarded, an armed Milosevic is going around getting rid of refugees, doing what he wants, acting freely on his territory, and we are attacking buildings and storage sites. 
If this were to go on for too long, it is very likely that Milosevic would have the time to do what he intends to do, and even though his weapon storage sites have been destroyed, he would have achieved his goal.  
Lets us look at what has been gained from a few weeks of bombing. 
In Albania, for example, more than 500,000 refugees are crammed in camps, schools, factories, hospitals and Albanian foster families. 
Living conditions as reported by international agencies are described as ``not too bad''. 
However, Albania will not be able to cope for very long without substantial assistance from the international community.  
In Macedonia, more than 115,000 refugees are crowded into camps surrounded by barbed wire and controlled by the Macedonian authorities. 
Conditions are very difficult, and the Macedonian authorities have warned the international community on several occasions that they could not take in any more. 
Most of the refugees are women and children.  
There are 25,000 refugees in Bosnia as well. 
There are 60,000 in Montenegro and 6,000 in Turkey. 
Over 100,000 middle aged and young men have disappeared. 
So, for the moment, some 800,000 Kosovars are still in their homes, that is, less than the original population of this country, which was some 1,800,000.  
Macedonia's parliament issued an appeal for help to the international community. 
Initially, the Macedonian parliamentarians asked for financial and material help and support for the NGOs in order to take charge of the refugees. 
Macedonia has already spent $200 million as a direct result of the atrocities committed in Kosovo, of an annual gross domestic product of $3 billion. 
That is fairly close to 10%.  
The parliament also asked NATO members to take in refugees in order to give their countries relief, and this explains the hasty agreement by NATO countries to take in refugees.  
Some 30% of the Macedonian population were Albanian speakers, and the authorities feared the ethnic balance would be upset by the influx of refugees. 
This explains in part their behaviour toward the refugees, the evacuations and border closures. 
They must be given all possible assistance.  
The assembly of the people of the republic of Albania also spoke out in total support of the NATO air strikes and called for ground troops to be sent urgently.  
Moreover, Albanian parliamentarians thank the international community for its help and ask that such help be increased to meet the growing needs of refugees and the population in northern Albania.  
The time has come to consider our options, whether military, political, humanitarian, diplomatic or other. 
On behalf of my party, I will propose a number of possible solutions, which we feel this House should contemplate.  
At the military level, even though we have not reached that stage yet, we think that ground military action should be considered, or at least discussed. 
We should look at the benefits and drawbacks of such action. 
The time has come to think about solutions other than the one being applied right now, that is air strikes.  
Since the beginning of the NATO air strikes, President Milosevic has accelerated the pace of the forced exodus of Albanian Kosovars. 
The police, the militia and the Serb army have continued and even intensified their action against the Kosovars. 
The net result of this is that with 500,000 refugees-or 621,000 since March 1998 according to the UNHCR-the objectives pursued with the air strikes have not produced the anticipated results, namely to stop the atrocities committed against the people of Kosovo, and nor have they led Milosevic to accept the Rambouillet peace plan.  
In that context, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the use of allied ground troops must be considered to stop the atrocities and the repression of which Kosovars are victims, this in light of Milosevic's firm resolve not to make any concession about Kosovo, which is the cradle of the Serb nation.  
This intervention to impose peace should be organized, or at least considered as quickly as possible. 
In fact, the border closings, the mines laid at the borders, and the numerous atrocities against the Kosovars reveal the intentions of Milosevic and his security forces to commit genocide against the Kosovo people.  
NATO's military intervention on the ground could allow all Kosovar refugees to go back home, not just some of them. 
NATO must, therefore, liberate all of Kosovo. 
This option is the one more closely matching the reason why Canada and NATO are fighting: to implement a peace plan, the Rambouillet peace plan, and to stop the atrocities against the Kosovo people.  
At the political level, solutions are also possible, including UN involvement and the application of international law. 
On April 9, Kofi Annan called for a conditional cease-fire and for Yugoslavian compliance with the numerous UN resolutions. 
It is vital for the UN, its security council in particular, to be involved in this crisis.  
Canada has a duty to try, by every means possible, to submit to the council a draft peace agreement reflecting the main thrust of Rambouillet.  
On January 19, 1999, the security council denounced Yugoslavia's refusal to allow the international tribunal prosecutor to investigate the Racak massacre. 
This request for an inquiry was a follow-up to resolutions 1160, 1199 and 1203, all issued in 1998. 
Finally, there should be a free and democratic consultation of Kosovars regarding the future status of Kosovo.  
From a humanitarian point of view, consideration should be given to ongoing and unconditional aid. 
The decisions we make today will have an impact on the decisions our children will have to make in 20, 25 or 30 years. 
Canada cannot slough off 25 or 30 years from now responsibilities it takes on today. 
Canada is at war against the Serbs and Canada will have to help the people it has fought, the people who have suffered in this war.  
Canada will have to help them, and it must think about helping them not just while the bombing is taking place, but also in the years, and there will be many, of rebuilding ahead.  
There is a strong risk that the rush of refugees to the Republic of Macedonia and to Albania will destabilize these regimes. 
Massive, unconditional and direct assistance is therefore necessary if the conflict is not to spread throughout the region.  
The appeals from these two countries must be taken seriously and Canada has a responsibility to respond. 
Beyond these geopolitical contingencies, all western countries have an obligation to provide all conceivable aid to the populations displaced by these conflict.  
This aid requires, and will continue to require, significant assistance over a long period. 
Canada must prepare for this and show its support for non-government organizations such as UNHCR, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent immediately.  
Airlifting refugees to Canada has already been considered and careful preparations for this must continue. 
Canada is willing to receive those displaced persons wishing to come here. 
However, the government must quickly clarify their status.  
Diplomatically, it is vital that thought be given to the chaos that has prevailed in the Balkans since 1989. 
This situation has brought nothing but grief to the nations in the region, and has also caused many problems for the international community. 
Human tragedies, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and now the genocidal intent of the Milosevic regime are unacceptable events for humanity.  
The human as well as financial and political costs of such chaos are extremely high. 
Once the present armed conflict comes to an end, the situation in the Balkans will not be stabilized. 
Tensions will remain very high. 
Yugoslavian, Kosovar, Albanian and Macedonian infrastructures will be either destroyed or non existent. 
The financial and political situation in Kosovo, and also in Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia will remain disastrous.  
This massive help, which at first glance appears very significant, would be nothing compared to the cost of a war-torn region in the heart of Europe, a region which, instead of being part of the international community, would only bring chaos and desolation. 
Such a plan which would come under the authority of the European Union, but Canada and the United States should be involved; it would allow the region to move beyond war and its immediate consequences towards reconstruction and democracy instead of tensions and desolation.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the debate tonight precludes a discussion on options which were open to us one month ago, including whether to go to war with NATO, whether all avenues at the United Nations had been exhausted and whether the lessons learned in Bosnia are applicable to Kosovo.  
Tonight the debate takes place under different circumstances. 
We have concluded that the United Nations Security Council is impotent. 
We have seen images of genocide, of columns of refugees, of burning villages and of murdered civilians. 
We are participants in NATO's bombing actions.  
We are there to achieve security and peace for the people of Kosovo, to prevent another Bosnia and to bring stability to a troubled region of Europe. 
We are there to prevent actions of brutality such as those committed by Karadzic and General Mladic in Bosnia.  
It is a paradox that this humanitarian role should take the form of military action, all other avenues having been exhausted. 
It would have been preferable not to have taken military action, but facing the options available Canada chose the lesser of two evils, military action over allowing the genocide to continue.  
What do we wish to achieve through military action? 
The safe return to their homes of all deportees and displaced persons. 
The protection and care for those displaced inside Kosovo. 
The expulsion from Kosovo of Serbian military, police and paramilitary forces through a peacekeeping force, as was the case and is the case in Bosnia, Cyprus and other troubled spots in the world. 
The apprehension of indicted war criminals is amongst our goals, as well as the defence of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro in the event of a Serbian attack. 
Finally, we wish to achieve the improvement of communications from Europe into Kosovo and Serbia in order to inform the population of the reasons and motives for our actions.  
Looking beyond the immediate goals there is a role for Canada to play with like-minded nations in search of a mechanism that will provide rules for international intervention in domestic conflict. 
Canada has experts in preventive diplomacy. 
We can start with the UN convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. 
Article 8 of that convention is quite explicit. 
It states ``Any contracting party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations-as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide''.  
It is worth noting that 50 years after the general assembly agreed to the text of the genocide convention the United Nations Security Council established the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia. 
The prosecutor, Louise Arbour, is playing a strong leadership role. 
The tribunal is making good progress and increasingly commands respect.  
Those who disagree with Canada's military actions say that Canada is in violation of international law. 
In reply it must be noted that Yugoslavia, having engaged in acts of genocide, has violated the UN genocide convention.  
The time has come to put teeth into that convention, to reinforce the role of the international tribunal in The Hague and to lay the foundations for building adequate international preventive action for the future.  
As we saw today in question period, it is only natural that this debate should centre around the question of whether to send troops into Kosovo. 
Several speakers have raised that question. 
The answer seems fairly clear if we ask ourselves how returning civilians and the remaining population can be assured the necessary protection and how the removal of the Serbian police and armed forces can be achieved. 
Having taken the drastic step of intervening with air forces it becomes inevitable and necessary, for the same reasons we decided to risk the lives of Canadian pilots, to send in troops as well. 
Sending in troops so as to intervene on the ground will become inevitable almost as a law of military gravity.  
In 1939 it could be said that western democracies declared war when driven by exasperation, having exhausted all other means. 
It seems that in 1999 western democracies have become involved in the Balkans having exhausted all other means as well. 
Had this debate taken place one month ago I would have strongly advised against military intervention and for a greater effort through the general assembly of the United Nations. 
Today, with the decision of a military intervention having been made, while I find it repugnant to see Canada involved in the act of bombing, it would be even more repugnant at this point in time for Canada to abstain from participating in a severe action aimed at extirpating genocide and racial and ethnic persecution.  
I believe that we have drawn the correct lessons from what happened in Bosnia just a few years ago. 
Hopefully we will succeed in stopping the ugly forces of nationalism in Yugoslavia. 
Hopefully, when peace is restored, the security of people living in this troubled region of Europe will be assured regardless of ethnic origin, regardless of whether they are a majority or a minority, regardless of whether they are Christian, Muslim or of any other religious belief.  
I am glad to share my time with the member for Peterborough.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member has an excellent record on human rights issues in this House and a long service to Canada. 
He has certainly come to the same conclusion as I, that really we had no alternative as a member of NATO but to do what we did.  
However, I also think that certain planning and other things should have been done. 
It seems that we planned for the military campaign as part of NATO, but we seem to have forgotten that when bombs start to fall one of the natural things that occurs is that the number of refugees tends to increase. 
In effect, we seem to be doing some of the dirty work of Milosevic in driving more Albanians out of Kosovo.  
Could the hon. member comment on the fact that NATO seemed to be very prepared for the military action but not prepared at all for the human consequences of that military action?  
In Argentia, Newfoundland we have tried to find a way to open up Canadian government housing for refugees if they were to come to Canada. 
Many Newfoundlanders were willing to collect toys and clothes and do everything they could for these refugees had they come to Canada, and maybe some of them still will come.  
Would the hon. member not agree that NATO certainly prepared for the military campaign but did not take into the account the human consequences of that military campaign?  
Hon. Charles Caccia:
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The issue of refugees is one that prompted the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to make a very fine intervention and to lay out the position of the Government of Canada in its decision to accept refugees. 
In her speech she recognized the generosity and the spirit of the Canadian people vis-à-vis the movement of refugees in the past and at the present time.  
To expect NATO to be equipped to carry out a role in the movement of refugees is probably expecting something that organization is not equipped to carry out. 
That is probably why there is a UN commission for refugees that has been extremely active, particularly at the border of Macedonia and at the border of Albania.  
I am sure that the generosity of the people of Newfoundland will be greatly welcomed and will be reciprocated should refugees decide to come to our shores to settle in Canada.  
Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I can say that my colleague opposite has a very strong international conscience and that he weighed his words. 
I think that, tonight, we must weigh our words. 
I turned on the TV earlier and saw images that were really difficult to watch.  
The means are not that easy, but I would say that we have reached our limit. 
I think we must wake up and acknowledge that there is a conflict. 
The night will not be long for us, because we do not have to suffer.  
I personally do not have relatives over there, but if I had a sister, a mother, a brother or a child over there, it would be a lot more difficult for me. 
But one thing is sure: it is still our brothers and sisters who are suffering. 
I would prefer to say he his sick. 
If he is sick, we must see that he gets treatment. 
If he is cruel, we must at least make him understand his cruelty.  
I will come back later with other questions, but I would like to ask my colleague if he would personally have been in favour of a vote following this debate.  
Hon. Charles Caccia:
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his question.  
I share the same feelings he expressed when he talked about images that are difficult to watch and about the pain he feels when he thinks about our brothers and sisters who are suffering.  
To answer his question regarding a vote, I have no difficulty supporting the idea of a vote. 
Tonight, we all have the opportunity to state our position on the deployment of ground troops in Kosovo in the speeches and interventions we are ready to make.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, like 30 million other Canadians, I salute the courage, resolve and dedication of the men and women who serve in Canada's armed forces. 
Like every other member of parliament, I pray that whatever sacrifices we may ask those brave men and women to make, they are sacrifices based on wisdom. 
Whatever course we chart for them, let us back it up with every possible means of support from our nation. 
I had the honour yesterday to tour CFB Trenton. 
My colleagues in the House and everybody at home would be proud of the facilities for housing and medicine that have been created and set up for the refugees in such a very short time. 
I express my humble thanks to the people of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and the soldiers who have been working so hard around the clock to prepare a possible home for refugees.  
As someone who has visited Albania and possibly the only member of parliament who has been in Albania, I want everyone to know how difficult it is and will be for them to take so many refugees because of its own extreme economic difficulties. 
I hope that the nations of the world providing humanitarian aid will recognize that with real financial assistance to the harbouring countries such as Albania.  
While at the Trenton base yesterday I looked in the faces of fine young soldiers and I could not help but think that they are Canada's children and grandchildren. 
They are fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers so willing to serve and sacrifice, so full of life and promise and so very young. 
As we make decisions that affect those young lives let us remember that war may be necessary but it is also nasty. 
War may be noble but it is also numbing to the soul. 
War may be heroic but it is also horrifying. 
War may be glorious but it is also gore.  
Before victory comes violence. 
Before triumph comes tragedy. 
Before defeat of the enemy often comes much death. 
In the words of Milton, war truly is as terrible as hell.  
None of us doubt the need to take on Milosevic and his band of bloody thugs. 
In this century we have witnessed the monstrous consequences of madmen out of control. 
We know that pure evil must be driven out. 
We know that we cannot allow the slaughter of the innocent who are destroyed merely for being different. 
The action of Milosevic is so barbarous that we cannot find the real words to describe our disgust so we call it ethnic cleansing. 
We know that what he is doing is giving a wash of hatred to human decency. 
We know that what he is doing is giving a bath of poison to human dignity.  
Choosing when and where to intervene around the world is never easy for democracies. 
The line is often hazy and fluid but Milosevic is way over the line. 
He is seeking to empty Kosovo of its citizens by any means possible. 
For some mad reason he thinks that the ethnic background of Kosovars justifies his cruel and ceaseless campaign against them. 
The bottom line is that we can see the frightening parallels between Milosevic and past tyrants, and he must be stopped.  
That much said, let us as Canadians do everything we can to avoid the mistakes of previous wars. 
Let us be careful not to demonize Serbian Canadians. 
I was particularly concerned when a young Serbian Canadian mother came into my constituency office wondering what she could do to keep her children from being bullied at school. 
Let us remind ourselves that what we are opposing is Milosevic and his agenda and not innocent Serbians.  
Most important, let us be prepared to back our soldiers with more than words if they must move from peacekeepers to peacemakers to wagers of war. 
We are grateful that so far no Canadian has been a casualty over Kosovo but if and when the stakes are raised so are the risks.  
So far Milosevic has proven to be more bent on his wave of destruction than military experts foresaw. 
The analysts at NATO underestimated what it would take to stop Milosevic. 
That is understandable. 
It is tremendously difficult to plumb the depths of evil. 
Now we know that there are few limits to how far Milosevic is prepared to go. 
We know the depravity. 
Now we see the darker side of human nature. 
If NATO needs to go further let NATO be prepared. 
Let readiness match resolve. 
Before we send them forward, let our soldiers have the capacity to meet a master of depravity and the darkness.  
If at some point Canada needs to point more of our young soldiers in harm's way, can we be assured that ground troops or any other troops have the proper and finest equipment? 
Will Canadian troops have proper on site preparation and training? 
Will our troops have proper backup? 
More significant, if and when Canada commits ground troops, will all of our NATO partners also commit ground troops?  
Canadians do not expect every strategic and tactical decision to be laid out in advance or to be laid out in public. 
In turn Canadians expect that their concerns expressed in this place by members of parliament to be incorporated into the decision making process. 
I have absolute confidence in the Prime Minister doing so. 
That is why this non-partisan debate is so timely and so vital.  
Canadian soldiers have long served our nation with pride and long covered our nation with distinction. 
Fine young Canadians are carrying on with that tradition as we speak now. 
We need to give our soldiers every possible guarantee that the resources available to them will match their strength and their sense of duty. 
We owe it to them. 
They are the Canadians who will make the sacrifices, and we owe them the resources. 
They are the ones upholding the flame of liberty, and we owe them all our wisdom. 
We owe them that.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I got the impression that the hon. member believes that an intervention such as this one by NATO is justified in certain situations.  
Could the hon. member tell me if she thinks that an intervention is made under a right to get involved recognized under the international law?  
Ms. Beth Phinney:
Madam Speaker, we have seen some pretty disastrous scenes on television lately. 
We have gone through wars in the past. 
I do not like the idea, but I feel we are justified in entering this war.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member had to say. 
I was particularly interested in her personal experience of the base at Trenton and what was going on there. 
I also understand that the member, unlike many of us, has some personal experience in Albania. 
Could she share those two personal experiences with us?  
Ms. Beth Phinney:
Madam Speaker, maybe I could first say a few words about Albania. 
I was there three or four years ago. 
It was the first vote Albania had ever had for democracy, the first vote at all.  
They had the communist side and the democratic side. 
They won on their first vote. 
Some of them felt they did not. 
The democrats got 40% of the vote and thought they had lost because they had never had a vote before. 
They did not understand that still meant they had won because they had their first opposition ever. 
In the following year they had another election and they won.  
It is quite amazing what they are trying to do. 
The ones who are working earn approximately $50 a year. 
They showed me their food, their groceries for the week. 
They had brown bags and in them they had potatoes and onions. 
That is what they were eating that week. 
Mothers were taking their groceries home for their children.  
They have done things like cut down all the trees for firewood because they did not have any other means of fire. 
They had great spirit and were so excited about having their first vote that 99.9% of the people voted in the election. 
It was quite amazing.  
They are being sent some 300,000 to 500,000 people and will be asked to help them out. 
That is why I was saying that I was hoping the international countries that will be giving aid will help Albania and other countries like it where the refugees will be going, because the people already in those countries are not much better off than the refugees themselves.  
It was pretty exciting at Trenton. 
They are very prepared and we should be very proud of them.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate, although I must start my comments by saying that it is not the type of debate that I was hoping for today.  
Some members have certainly talked about this point already. 
At the end every member of parliament should know that they will have to stand in the House to take a position either for or against the motion. 
Certainly that will increase the level of interest and will reach out and involve a lot more Canadians in the debate.  
Three objectives must be considered in this debate. 
The first is the moral objective. 
We cannot overstate the case on this issue. 
The moral objective is the halting of ethnic cleansing. 
Ethnic cleansing means killing. 
Ethnic cleansing means the expulsion of people from their homes, the burning of their homes, and the expulsion of people from their country. 
We must halt this ethnic cleansing. 
I do not think we can possibly overstate the urgency of dealing with that situation.  
These political objectives involve creating a safe home for Kosovars on their own soil. 
That must be the political objective of everything we are taking part in and it must be done through internationally supervised negotiation.  
I have heard many people state today that they believe Russia should be involved in these international negotiations. 
There is a great deal of value in that and hopefully, that can be accommodated.  
The military objective has to damage the Serbs' military capability to reduce their capacity to kill, to remove people from their homes, to destroy people's homes and to throw people out of the country. 
We have to reduce their capacity so they cannot do those things. 
That has to be one of the military objectives. 
When we get them to that point then we can get them to the negotiating table. 
We all know it is only through negotiations that we can hope to put an end to this sad situation in Kosovo.  
How do we accomplish the military objectives? 
That is where there has been a lot of disagreement in this House. 
I am really pleased at the level of support in this House for that objective.  
Also as the member of parliament from Lakeland constituency, I am proud that many of my constituents from the Cold Lake air base are involved in the military operations, are involved in the air strikes. 
The job they are doing and the commitment they have shown are to be commended. 
It is important in a situation like this one to show support for the men and women in our forces and for the extremely important role they are playing and I do so right now. 
There is a lot of agreement on the use of air strikes. 
The real difference seems to lie for the most part in the use of ground forces to complete that objective if necessary. 
There must be two conditions for committing Canadian ground troops. 
The first is that NATO demonstrate that this commitment in fact is necessary. 
Can NATO demonstrate that? 
Has it been able to do this so far? 
No. 
We do not know whether we will need ground troops. 
We do not know how effective the air strikes are going to be. 
We have heard differing opinions on that in the House. 
We have certainly heard one opinion from CNN which after the first three or four days when it could not see any progress said it ain't working. 
That is not good enough. 
We have to give it the time that is needed. 
We may find that the air strikes will go a long way to solving the problem.  
The second condition is that the government must demonstrate to this House that Canada can meet the commitment laid out by NATO.  
Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time with the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca and so I probably only have two minutes left.  
It is important that the government demonstrate to this House and to Canadians that Canadians will be able to meet the commitment and do the job that NATO delegates to them. 
That decision is to be made by the chief of the defence staff. 
That is the role of the chief of the defence staff.  
It is the role of the government, the role of this House and not just the role of the governing party, to determine what Canada's involvement should be. 
It is the role of the chief of the defence staff to determine what our military capabilities are. 
That is critical and that job must be left to the chief of the defence staff.  
Those are some of the military considerations.  
I would like to close by asking the minister of immigration a few questions with regard to refugees and Canada's commitment to accepting refugees who have been displaced from Kosovo. 
What is the minister's position on this issue? 
It is unclear to me.  
Last week the minister said that she would accept 5,000 refugees on a temporary basis. 
They would come not as refugees but through normal immigration channels. 
I would appreciate clarification by the minister.  
I get one message from Mr. Girard who went to Kosovar and evaluated the situation and another message from the minister. 
It is very important that this be clarified. 
I look forward to the minister's clarification.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
All of us in the House have learned a great deal throughout the course of this debate and the member has added to that information sharing session.  
The member speaks of the preconditions for the possibility of ground troops becoming involved. 
Quite rightly he and his leader have both pointed out the necessity of further information as to Canada's role in terms of doing everything possible to achieve a peaceful solution to this and also the assurance that is needed with respect to the protection of our fighting forces if it should come to that. 
We are now painfully and sadly aware that our Canadian armed forces are ill equipped should it come to the eventual inevitability that ground forces might be sent and Canadian armed forces personnel would be in harm's way.  
Does the hon. member feel that another consideration which might lead to that is the information that seems to be readily available that perhaps greater atrocities are currently taking place such as the murder of the 100,000 Kosovar men who appear to be missing within the boundaries of Yugoslavia? 
Should that also be a major consideration in the determination of a potential ground force deployment?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Madam Speaker, if the objective of this military involvement is to meet a moral obligation to protect Kosovars, clearly if an atrocity such as that has occurred, then the urgency has been stepped up another major notch. 
If that has occurred, we know it will probably happen again. 
The urgency is beyond anything I can express and certainly it is a critical consideration.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Madam Speaker, if the Progressive Conservative member is right when he says that 100,000 men have disappeared, it may be that this is no longer ethnic cleansing but genocide.  
If we were to discover that the Serb government and the security forces of Slobodan Milosevic are guilty of genocide, would that justify very quickly the sending of ground troops into Kosovo?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Madam Speaker, that is a very difficult question. 
That decision should be made with a lot of input from Canadians.  
If we did find that such a genocide had occurred, I still believe that the three main objectives would have to be followed through on and the two conditions for the military objective would still have to be in place. 
In other words, is the bombing doing the job? 
Is it going to lead to the Yugoslavs, whether it be Milosevic or someone else, getting to the negotiating table? 
Is this bombing going to do the job and force that to happen?  
I do not think that question has been answered yet. 
It still may be effective. 
Even if we find this has happened, that has to be evaluated by people who know far more than I do.  
Second, if the government cannot demonstrate to the House with the input from the chief of the defence staff that our Canadian troops are capable of carrying out the task given them by the NATO command, then why would we put our Canadian troops at risk? 
If it can be demonstrated and if we do find out that the bombing is not going to prevent atrocities like this from happening, if this has happened already and if there is some belief that it could be happening again very soon, then in that case I would fully support the immediate use of ground troops, including Canadian ground troops.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, if history has taught us anything, it is that we have learned nothing. 
Across the world, from Angola, Sierra Leone to the Sudan we have seen countries implode and thousands of civilians killed. 
In fact 90% of the casualties that are borne in the wars of today are innocent civilians, unlike what happened in the first part of the century. 
What all these situations have in common is they demonstrate an abysmal failure on the part of the international community to get involved before thousands of people have been killed and countries have been laid to waste.  
Kosovo is the latest of those countries, the one that is the apple of the eye of the media, the one that is drawing the most attention. 
It is by no means that which is going to be the greatest in terms of death and destruction in our world today.  
As I said before, in Sierra Leone hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and thousands more are killed every day. 
In northern Uganda 10,000 child soldiers between the ages of eight and twelve are committing horrendous atrocities and thousands of young girls of the same age are used as sexual concubines. 
No one hears about that, no one talks about it and no one cares.  
The situation in front of us is one where we had some very difficult choices to make, to act or not to act in the face of Kosovo. 
With the memory of Croatia and the memory of the atrocities of Banja Luka, Srebrenica, Bihac and Sarajevo fresh in our minds, we chose thankfully to act. 
And act we did, perhaps not in the best way, but we acted.  
There were a number of obligations and end points we wanted to accomplish. 
The first was the most important, to save the innocent civilians' lives. 
The second was to bring Slobodan Milosevic to the table to engage in a diplomatic solution to this problem.  
The fact is Milosevic is not at the table and while we were bombing Belgrade, the ethnic cleansing continued. 
The reason is simply that bombing will not stop ethnic cleansing, or should I use the proper term, mass murder, that takes place door to door, person to person, eyeball to eyeball. 
That will not stop it, although I must say that I applaud and support the government's support of NATO's bombing in the federal republic of Yugoslavia.  
Our current objective has several goals. 
The moral obligation is to save people's lives. 
No one disagrees with that. 
The political obligation is to get Milosevic back to the table and stop further ethnic cleansing. 
It is also to engage in a diplomatic solution.  
I would argue that the diplomatic solution put forward at Rambouillet, France is now a dead duck. 
The notion of an autonomous Kosovo will not happen. 
Too much blood has been shed, too many people have been killed and the memories last a very long time. 
These people, quite frankly, are not going to live together.  
How are we going to deal with this problem? 
The first solution is to protect innocent civilians. 
The way to do that is to organize a safe haven in the southern part of Kosovo. 
This can be accomplished with minimal or no casualties on the part of the west, but it will involve ground troops. 
Ground troops are required to engage in a safe haven in southern Kosovo and those ground troops, in my view, should be European Union troops. 
The reason is that they were tasked five years ago to deal with the impending implosion of the former Yugoslavia and they sat on their hands. 
They sat on their hands and thousands of people were killed, maimed and left homeless.  
The European Union troops could engage in this, which would accomplish the following. 
First, it would protect the Kosovar Albanians. 
Second, it would enable humanitarian aid to get to these people safely and efficiently. 
Third, if these people are going to be repatriated at the end of a politically organized solution, then it is far easier for them to be repatriated while in their own backyard than for them to be repatriated while spread far afield. 
It will not do to send these people all over the world and expect that at some point in the future they will somehow wind up back in Kosovo. 
That simply is not going to happen.  
It would involve the partition of Kosovo. 
As I said before, these people are not going to live together. 
Why I think this is doable is that Milosevic wants the northern half of Kosovo because that is where the Field of Black Birds is and that is where the seat of Serbian nationalism comes from. 
That is primarily what he wants, along with some mines which I think are less relevant.  
If we try to bring the two together it will involve a ground war and a lot of allied troops being killed. 
At best, it will be apparent victory. 
A ground war is not something that anybody has the stomach for.  
The long term political solution must involve Serbians coming to the table, but how do we do this? 
One of our failures has been to assume that Mr. Milosevic deals with the same moral framework that we do. 
He does not. 
He is the one who is responsible for the slaughter in Bosnia. 
He is the one who instigated the slaughter which we saw in the towns of Srebrenica, Bihac and Banja Luka. 
He is the one who engaged in a ground war with Croatia. 
He is the one who is largely responsible, with his leadership, for the implosion of the former Yugoslavia.  
We have to recognize that we are not dealing with a familiar creature. 
In fact, I would liken him to Hitler. 
Appeasement was attempted in the late 1930s when Hitler was committing atrocities. 
It did not work then and it certainly will not work today. 
We have to use a different framework to deal with a creature like Slobodan Milosevic.  
First, to bring him to the table will mean engaging in bombing, but I think it has to happen.  
Second, we could use economic levers through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
Both of those groups have enormously powerful economic levers to apply to any country and they must be applied to the federal republic of Yugoslavia. 
If we choke off the money supply we greatly diminish the ability of Milosevic to carry out a war for any lengthy period of time.  
Third is something we have not looked upon which is the propaganda war. 
Many people in Serbia are falling behind their leader partly as a result of the bombing we have engaged in. 
Any time a country is bombed it is more likely the people no matter how much they despise their leader, will fall behind their leader not out of support for the individual but out of support for their country.  
Therefore we have to get into the propaganda game. 
We need to use short-wave radio. 
The UN and other groups have the capability of beaming in what is taking place in Kosovo. 
We need to use television to demonstrate what is taking place in Kosovo and also the atrocities that took place in Croatia and in Bosnia. 
The people in Serbia do not know what their leadership has been up to and it is high time they did. 
If we are going to undermine Mr. Milosevic we have to do it from within. 
The easiest and most efficient way is by informing the Serbian public of what he is responsible for.  
It is important for us to demonstrate and articulate to the Serbian people that our problem is not with them but with their leadership. 
I am sure that the Serbian people, like other people of the former Yugoslavia, want peace, that they want to live in harmony. 
Let us not forget that 10% of the population of Kosovo is Serbian. 
They have no stomach for killing as I am sure the vast majority of Kosovar Albanians have no stomach for killing. 
Unfortunately we see the manipulation by political leaderships to engage in war or to compromise their people at any price.  
At the end of the day we have the Kosovo situation and we will have more Kosovos as time passes. 
I have been in war situations. 
I have seen people with their legs blown off from land mines. 
I have seen teenagers hold their bowels in their hands after being eviscerated by guerrillas. 
These are innocent people who did not ask for this.  
I implore the government to try to change its foreign policy from one of conflict management to one of conflict prevention. 
I introduced a motion which will come up for debate on Monday. 
It articulates a series of methods for identifying the precursors to conflict and pragmatic tools such as the use of diplomacy and economic levers that have not been explored to prevent conflict from occurring.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask our colleague from the Reform Party, who suggested that we put the emphasis on the prevention of disputes and that we set up a prevention mechanism, what international organization should be responsible for such a mechanism.  
Should it be the UN? 
Should it be the OSCE? 
Or should NATO itself be involved in the prevention and the settlement of disputes?  
Mr. Keith Martin:
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
We are lacking in leadership in the world today. 
In the post cold war situation we have to develop a new framework within which to work.  
Some people have made the mistake of believing that NATO can get involved in conflicts as far away as Africa and the Far East. 
As the member alluded to, we have to engage in ways to deal with conflict all over the world. 
There are three bodies that can do this. 
The first is the United Nations. 
Kosovo demonstrates the failure of the UN. 
The security council rooted in its 1945 organization needs to be revamped. 
The IMF and the World Bank are the other two organizations that make up the three organized at Bretton Woods in 1945. 
They can engage in economic actions against a country that is engaging in behaviours that compromise international and regional security.  
The argument in support of that is that countries engaging in a flagrant abuse of human rights and local or international security are an economic threat to those areas. 
They are engaging in bad economics. 
Why should the international community put money into countries that might use that money to buy arms to abuse people or engage in or support a conflict in their area? 
They do not have to. 
Within the IMF, the World Bank and the United Nations lies the tools that can be utilized. 
I might add that the United Nations is the toughest nut to crack.  
While we are on the security council we need to have the courage to articulate the tough solutions that have to be put forward to enable the United Nations to change from being completely and utterly unable to deal with conflicts in a proactive manner to a body that can. 
There are many arguments to be made for that from a humanitarian argument to a cold-hearted economic argument.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on his speech. 
I thought it was very thoughtful.  
I wanted to ask him if he looked at the situation over the last two, three or four weeks and questioned himself. 
Does he think the role of NATO in this exercise has reduced hostilities or exacerbated the situation?  
Mr. Keith Martin:
Madam Speaker, that is a difficult question but I thank my hon. member for asking it. 
The litmus test in all this is our prime objective of saving the lives of innocent civilians.  
Clearly Mr. Milosevic was engaging in a process of ethnic cleansing. 
Perhaps NATO was brought in late but it was brought in and saved the lives of some people. 
Not as many as it should have because of the tardiness involved. 
As I mentioned in my speech there are other things NATO could have been involved in. 
I do not think it has increased the hostilities.
