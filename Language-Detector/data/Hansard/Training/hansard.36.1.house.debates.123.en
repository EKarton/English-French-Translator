HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Tuesday, September 22, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Prayers 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the government's response to ten petitions.  
* * * 
PETITIONS 
THE FAMILY 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this petition is signed by grandparents who as a result of death, separation or divorce of their children are often denied access to their grandchildren by their guardians.  
Legislation in several provincial jurisdictions, including Quebec and Alberta, contains provisions to ensure the right of access of the grandparent to their grandchildren.  
The petitioners would like parliament to support private member's Bill C-340 regarding the rights of grandparents to have access to or custody of the children.  
BILL C-68 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today, as thousands of law-abiding, responsible gun owners are congregating on Parliament Hill, I am pleased to present 605 pages of petitions with 13,933 signatures of concerned citizens from Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, B.C. and the Yukon calling on the government to repeal Bill C-68, the Firearms Act. 
My constituents have asked me to keep a running total of the repeal of Bill C-68 petitions. 
This year I have introduced 744 pages with 17,342 signatures.  
These Canadians are very concerned that this billion dollar licensing and registration scheme will do nothing to curtail the criminal use of firearms, is not cost effective in addressing the violent crime problem in Canada, is putting tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy and is opposed by the majority of police on the street and the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and the Yukon.  
Therefore, they request parliament to repeal Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, and spend their hard earned tax dollars on more cost effective, crime fighting measures such as hiring more police to fight organized crime and more crime prevention programs.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member who spoke before me, I too have a petition to submit with respect to Bill C-68, the gun control legislation.  
I would like to table this petition on behalf of the constituents of Brandon-Souris.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
BILL C-68 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege on this particular day, as we have a large number of citizens across Canada coming to protest the gun law, to be able to present on behalf of 100 members of my constituency of Nanaimo-Cowichan a petition expressing their opposition to Bill C-68, the gun registration law. 
They feel that it is nothing more than an illegitimate tax grab of their money and that it will do nothing to really curtail crime on the streets.  
They indicate that criminals do not register their guns.  
SENIORS BENEFITS 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac-Mégantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table before the House a petition signed mainly by citizens of Stornoway, urging the federal government not to consider average family income in the calculation of seniors benefits.  
I strongly support my fellow citizens of Stornoway.  
DIVORCE ACT 
Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition signed by many Canadians requesting that the Divorce Act be amended.  
They are concerned about grandparents, who are often cut off from their grandchildren after a divorce, death or separation.  
BILL C-68 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured today to stand on behalf of my constituents of Battlefords-Lloydminster to present petitions on their behalf regarding Bill C-68. 
With the big rally here today it is very timely.  
JOYRIDING 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present four petitions today. 
The first petition requests parliament to amend the Criminal Code of Canada to increase the minimum and maximum penalties for the offence of joyriding, since joyriding, which is a misnomer, is car theft and people want it treated as such.  
AGE OF CONSENT 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, other petitioners call upon parliament to amend the Criminal Code to raise the age of consent for sexual activity between young people and an adult from 14 to 16 years of age.  
There are some very sad cases in British Columbia where people have been wooed into prostitution at a very young age.  
CHILDREN 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, other petitioners call upon parliament to amend the criminal code to increase surveillance and supervision of those convicted of sex offences against children.  
YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):

QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
.[Text]  
Question No. 62- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Can the government provide a detailed outline of the process used by the Pest Management Review Agency to determine how levels are set for cost recovery?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Cost recovery is a federal government policy established for deficit reduction. 
For the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the level of cost recovery was set at $22 million by cabinet when the agency was created in 1995.  
The government process to determine how cost recovery levels are set is a Treasury Board policy. 
The Pest Management Regulatory Agency implemented this Treasury Board policy under the supervision of Treasury Board officials.  
They confirmed that our proposed fees were based on cost of providing the service.  
Representatives from Treasury Board Secretariat, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, Industry Canada, and Natural Resources Canada participated fully in the various impact assessments. 
Treasury Board Secretariat was involved in the planning of the business impact test conducted on the Pest Management Regulatory Agency cost recovery proposals. 
Treasury Board Secretariat and Industry Canada representatives attended the April 22, 1996 business impact test meetings with stakeholders. 
Representatives of the above departments attended the May 29, 1996 meeting of the Interim Canadian Pest Management Advisory Council to discuss the impact assessments. 
On September 20, 1996, Treasury Board Secretariat called an interdepartmental meeting, attended by the Privy Council Office, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, Industry Canada, Natural Resources Canada and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in preparation for the September 23 and 30, 1996 meetings with stakeholders.  
Re-engineering processes established by the new Agency provided savings which reduced the cost recovery portion of the budget to $15 million. 
This amount was further reduced by another $3 million for the next six years through grants from Health Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. 
The total amount to be cost recovered as delineated in the regulatory Impact Analysis Statement of April 16, 1997, is $12 million.  
Question No. 66- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Concerning individuals and businesses who have to pay fees allocated by the Pest Management review Agency, can the government please provide a list of all user fees these individuals or businesses have to pay?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are two types of fees: 
The fee for the various data components range from $150.00 to $98,248.00. 
The fee payable for one application is equal to the sum of the applicable fees for all the components included in the application. 
As well reduced applications fees are offered to facilitate access to the Canadian market for low volume, niche products. 
To be eligible for a reduced fee, a registrant's revenue from sales in Canada of the pest control product(s) during the three years of the sales verification period must be less than ten times the applicable application fees.  
2. An annual maintenance fee of $2,690.00 is charged per registered product (per PCP number) for the right to manufacture or sell a product in Canada. 
Mr. Peter Adams:
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Is it agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
SUPPLY 
ALLOTTED DAY-FIREARMS ACT 
That this House condemns the governement for its refusal to replace Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, with legislation targeting the criminal misuse of firearms and revoke their firearm registration policy that, in the opinion of this House: (a) confiscates private property; (b) contains unreasonable search and seizure provisions; (c) violates Treasury Board cost/benefit guidelines; (d) represents a waste of taxpayers dollars; (e) is an affront to law-abiding firearms owners; and (f) will exacerbate the illicit trafficking in firearms.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, I want to let the table and the Speaker know that Reform Party members will be dividing their time today into 10 minute speeches each.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw:
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to move the motion before us and to speak in favour of it.  
It has been said that bad laws are the worst form of tyranny. 
What we have in Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, is legislation that violates the property rights of Canadians and is a colossal waste of our money.  
The intended purpose of Bill C-68, quite frankly, is an insult to the three million firearms owners in Canada. 
The reason for what I have just said will become evident as we listen to the course of debate throughout the day.  
Allow me to begin by explaining the motives of the Liberal government in pursuing a firearms registry.  
It was the current health minister and former justice minister responsible for this legislation who said that it is his firm belief that only the police and military should have access to firearms.  
Let us analyse that statement. 
What we have is a Toronto lawyer with no concept of what life is like in rural Canada. 
The minister is trying to lead Canadians to believe that criminalizing the legal ownership of firearms will somehow reduce crime.  
Let us be clear. 
We are talking about hunting rifles and shotguns, not handguns. 
We have had a handgun registry since 1934 and we all know the extent to which crime has been reduced by that measure, do we not?  
Will it somehow reduce crime? 
How will that affect the criminal misuse of firearms?  
The minister may not be aware of this fact but criminals do not register their guns nor do they break into people's homes and decide not to steal a gun because it is registered. 
I will go out on a limb and suggest that the criminal who does steal a firearm is not going to decide whether or not to use it in the commission of an offence based on whether it is or is not registered.  
It is important that we understand where these people are coming from. 
They do not understand that to a farmer in Saskatchewan a .22 rifle is a tool. 
Toronto lawyers do not usually face rabid skunks walking on to their property. 
Then again many farmers in Saskatchewan would argue that a Toronto lawyer is a rabid skunk. 
In any event, the usefulness of a rifle as a tool to rural Canadians is very important. 
However, that fact may not be readily apparent to those who are trying to socially re-engineer Canadians.  
What do they mean when they say that registration is a first step? 
The minister can declare 10 gauge shotguns prohibited and they can be confiscated without compensation to the owners. 
Then it could be 12 gauge shotguns, 16 gauge, 20 gauge and eventually the elimination of all legal firearm ownership in Canada.  
The motion we have put forward today covers an extensive list of deficiencies in this bill. 
I will speak to one aspect of the motion, Treasury Board cost benefit guidelines. 
According to Treasury Board policy when the government is preparing to establish new regulations it must provide a cost benefit analysis of those regulations. 
The policy states specifically: ``When regulating, regulatory authorities must ensure that benefits outweigh the costs to Canadians, their governments and businesses, and the limited resources available to government are used where they will do the most good''.  
The new gun registration system established under Bill C-68 has failed the Treasury Board test. 
In particular, the government has left a number of important questions unanswered. 
For instance, what is the approximate number of individuals to be licensed? 
The government does not know. 
What is the approximate number of firearms to be registered? 
That is undetermined. 
What will the impact on businesses and the economy be? 
It is Yet to be seen. 
How many jobs will be lost? 
How many business closures will there be? 
Again we do not know. 
Will these regulations improve public safety? 
Clearly the evidence before us which we will see today is very strongly in the negative.  
With these questions unanswered it is impossible to determine the cost effectiveness of registration. 
Despite this, the government is pushing ahead with its registration plan. 
The reason is that it is the government's first step in eliminating legal firearm ownership in Canada.  
Registration was supposed to begin October 1 but that date has been pushed back to December 1. 
The registration system was originally projected to cost $85 million. 
Cost projections are now well over $120 million. 
Some are estimating the system will actually cost over $500 million. 
Considering these huge sums of money I think we could agree this money could be better spent on areas such as health care, education and tax cuts to lower and middle income Canadians who are burdened excessively by the high spending ways of this Liberal government. 
The government did not do a cost benefit analysis of this legislation because it did not want to impede its efforts to eliminate legal firearm ownership in Canada.  
I am very pleased that the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville has seconded my motion. 
I urge all members of this House to listen very carefully not only to what I have said and not only to the analysis of the legislation that we are about to hear from the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville but to all hon. members who speak in support of this motion today.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly enjoyed the presentation by the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt today on Bill C-68.  
The one thing he did not touch on and the way the government is selling this is on the proof that there will be tremendous criminal reduction in activity there. 
There will be fewer suicides. 
Domestic violence of course will be toned down and so on.  
Does he have any thoughts in that regard? 
Does he know other jurisdictions where this has been tried? 
What were the results?  
Mr. Jim Pankiw:
Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that in every jurisdiction in the world where a gun registration exists, not one case of a crime solved or prevented can be demonstrated.  
I would also like to correct myself earlier. 
I believe the leader of official opposition will be resuming debate at the end of this question and answer session.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, subsequent to the Liberals passing this legislation in my riding five people were blown away one night with a gun. 
I do not think we found the registration certificates of those who did it in the area. 
They did not leave anything behind.  
I guess it brings to mind the question about really how much gun control legislation will prevent crime. 
I would like the hon. member to address that situation specifically. 
How much in Canada are we preventing crime, the criminal use of firearms, by this legislation?  
Mr. Jim Pankiw:
Mr. Speaker, as I explained in my speech, what we see from the criminal misuse of handguns is that first of all, criminals do not register their handguns. 
Second, the registration of a handgun does not prevent its theft by a criminal or subsequent use in a crime by that criminal.  
I think by logical extension we can assume that the registration of hunting rifles will serve no useful purpose whatsoever. 
The costs that we will have to bear as a result of this registration system will be enormous.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want members to know that in replying, the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt did not reply to the question that was asked of him.  
He was asked to supply details, some facts, some statistics, not some speculation.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I am wondering if my colleague could perhaps enlighten us all on the reasons why this government continues to press on with, this flying in the face of the wishes of millions of people across this country.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw:
Mr. Speaker, that question can be asked of almost anything this Liberal government does. 
Why has this government increased taxes 37 times in the last four years? 
Why does it impoverish middle income Canadians with their excessive tax burdens?  
Those questions are harder to answer than the one regarding why it is pursing a firearms registration opposed by so many Canadians and which will clearly achieve no benefit to Canadians in that regard.  
In the Liberals' minds if they can have everyone register their firearms then they will know where those firearms are, what they are and they can systematically by order in council declare them prohibited and then confiscate them.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My second reason for participating is today a large group of Canadians are assembling on Parliament Hill for what they had styled as a fed up rally in which they will be exercising their democratic rights to protest a government policy to which they object.  
I want to address my remarks both to the House and to this broader audience of Canadians who are here today mainly because I think a democratic protest, the right to democratic protest and the necessity of this House to recognize democratic process need some beefing up and some reassurance at this time.  
The members on this side of the House have observed since we came here in 1993 that the present Liberal government is weak on democracy. 
The Liberals permit no free votes in this House on government bills. 
They continue to permit 25% of the members of this parliament, I refer to our unelected, unaccountable senators, to be appointed by one man, the Prime Minister, rather than to be elected by the people.  
Last year the Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister told the RCMP that the rights of an Asian dictator to freedom from embarrassment were more important than the rights of Canadians to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  
The government is weak on democracy, even hostile to the exercise of democratic freedoms. 
So the presence of this group of Canadians here in Ottawa today in particular to express their democratic objections to Bill C-68 needs some bolstering, some amplification and some recognition in this Chamber, and that is my second reason for participating in this debate.  
With respect to Bill C-68, the government's ill conceived gun control legislation, I was the last speaker on that bill when it went through the House in June 1995. 
Some members will remember that was the conclusion of a long debate in which members such as the member for Crowfoot, the member for Yorkton-Melville, the member for Wild Rose and others put forward a host of amendments concerning the defects of the bill. 
Many of those defects have now come home to roost. 
At that time they were academic, sort of projections of what might happen. 
Now they are self-evident to many Canadians.  
Members, not just on this side of the House but on other sides of the House, put forward more than 200 amendments to try to correct the defects of that bill. 
The official opposition's position on Bill C-68 has not changed from 1995. 
We maintain, first of all, that it is constitutionally defective. 
It contains no affirmation of economic rights and therefore it is easier for legislation to infringe on things like property rights.  
However this bill is also constitutionally defective in that it infringes on provincial jurisdiction. 
Again we have a case of provinces challenging the jurisdiction of the federal government in this area.  
Personally I am becoming increasingly alarmed at the number of confrontations between this government and the provinces. 
It has infringed on rights of the provinces in the area of health care. 
It has slashed transfer payments to provinces in that area.  
The Prime Minister has a row going with the premiers on the proper distribution of rights and finances with respect to health care. 
There is a row with the provinces over the administration of gun control. 
We also maintain that the legislation is administratively unworkable and will lead to a wasteful expenditure of public funds which will in no way enhance public safety. 
No one in this House, certainly no one on this side of the House, believes the estimates of cost that are presented by ministers when they bring forward bills like Bill C-68.  
You will note that already, Mr. Speaker, the projected costs of administering the gun registration are three to four to five times higher than the figures that were quoted here by the minister when he introduced the legislation.  
The cost figures brought in with government proposals are utterly meaningless. 
We have to develop a multiplier, look at which minister it is, depending on how soft headed they are, and multiply by five, ten or fifteen to get the real cost implications of what they are doing.  
We therefore maintain that this legislation should be repealed and replaced with tough Criminal Code amendments targeted at the criminal misuse of firearms. 
That has been our position since 1995; it is our position at this time.  
I want to conclude by saying that this is our position. 
I do not think anyone doubts our commitment to it but more needs to be done. 
I address myself more to the people who are assembling in Ottawa today to protest this legislation. 
More needs to be done to translate opposition to this legislation into political action that will repeal it and replace it.  
If the House actually practised freedom of voting, it would be possible to amend this type of legislation and even replace it without defeating or replacing the government. 
Unfortunately because of the rigidities of the government, the intransigence of the Prime Minister on getting into the 20th century before it is over and permitting a more democratic exercise of freedom in voting in the House, the only way to repeal a government's position in the House is to get a bigger majority and actually replace the government.  
Bill C-68 will not be repealed and other Liberal policies will not be repealed or replaced until there are 150-plus members in the House who are committed to doing so. 
It cannot be done by 50 or 60 members no matter how sincere we are or how hard we work. 
To win votes, not just arguments in the House of Commons, we need a majority of 150-plus members.  
I therefore appeal to the people who are assembling in Ottawa today. 
I commend their efforts, those who are organizing this fed up rally, as one of the items on their posters says, to organize those who oppose Liberal policies into a politically powerful alternative voting block.  
As Leader of the Official Opposition I have a constitutional duty not just to hold the government accountable for its mistakes but to help create a viable alternative to the government, a united alternative to the Liberals for the 21st century.  
This is what my colleagues and I will be devoting much of our attention to over the next year. 
We welcome the advice, encouragement and support of the people meeting in Ottawa today.  
In the meantime we therefore welcome the opportunity to make clear our position on this issue and urge support of the motion: 
That this House condemns the government for its refusal to replace Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, with legislation targeting the criminal misuse of firearms and revoke their firearms registration policy that, in the opinion of this House: (a) confiscates private property; (b) contains unreasonable search and seizure provisions; (c) violates Treasury Board cost benefit quidelines; (d) represents a waste of taxpayers dollars; (e) is an affront to law-abiding firearms owners; and (f) will exacerbate the illicit trafficking in firearms.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition would stand in the House to attack a bill that deals specifically with the safety of our communities from coast to coast. 
I am surprised because I thought the Leader of the Opposition would stand to say that he was sorry his party voted against Bill C-68. 
I thought the Leader of the Opposition would stand to talk about all the benefits that exist in Bill C-68.  
I represent an urban riding. 
In my constituency-and I would say this is probably the case across the nation from coast to coast-there is overwhelming support for Bill C-68. 
There is overwhelming support for banning firearms. 
There is overwhelming support for the government's initiative when it comes to community safety across the country.  
I am surprised to see the Leader of the Opposition stand in the House to attack Bill C-68 and cater to the fundamentalists of firearms, those who have not taken the time and energy to read the bill to see what is in it. 
I have not seen one of those people come forward with a logical approach or logical reason for being opposed to it.  
I ask the Leader of the Opposition to tell all victims of stolen firearms specifically what is in Bill C-68 that he does not like.  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
First let me remind him that I also represent an urban riding, so I am not unfamiliar with the concerns of urban voters.  
This is criminal use of firearms which is precisely our position: target gun control legislation at criminals. 
That is not what the bill does and that is what we propose.  
Last, with respect to the matter of so-called public support for the bill, I suggest it is exactly in the same category as the Charlottetown accord. 
The government comes out with a proposal accompanied by all the PR it can muster, all the spin-doctoring and so on.  
When that happens the general level of support for that type of thing within the first few months is 60% to 65%. 
We have seen this time and time again, not just at the federal level but at the provincial level. 
However, as the public starts to learn what it is about, as the provinces and the municipal officials that have to administer it start to talk about the difficulties, as the costs start to pile up, and as they find out that the public has been misled as to the cost, where does that support go? 
It goes exactly in the same direction as it did on the Charlottetown accord. 
It goes down.  
At the end of the day there will be more support for the position on gun control that is being put forward by the official opposition than there will be for the bill that was put forward by the government.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. 
Generally speaking we in the Conservative Party embrace many of those comments. 
We are united in that approach, but I would quickly add that we are not united in anything else with the Reform Party.  
My question for the Leader of the Opposition is with respect to costs. 
I know this is a broad, sweeping piece of legislation which touches on civil rights and other property related issues like the ones before the court in Alberta.  
This debates today comes on the heels of the debate yesterday concerning Bill C-68. 
In terms of priority and the spiralling costs, would not the money be better spent on a registry that registers criminals and not guns?  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's comment that we are united in this approach. 
We are hopeful that we may be even more united in some other approaches, but that is a subject for further discussion.  
I agree with the suggestion implicit in the member's question. 
The dollars that are being invested in the registration of firearms, particularly when the people we are trying to get at, the people who will use firearms in a criminal manner, are the last people to participate in the registry. 
The justice minister can put an add in the Mafia magazine saying please register your firearms, but it is entirely unlikely that he will get a response that will justify that expense.  
I concur with the suggestion of the hon. member that if one is to register it might be better to register the people who are inclined to use firearms in a criminal way rather than to focus on the weapons.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again I rise in the House to participate in yet another debate on gun control initiated by the official opposition that just does not get it. 
Also I want to speak to Canadians.  
The Leader of the Opposition spoke about democratic freedoms. 
That is why we have people outside the House today demonstrating their opinion. 
In some other countries in the world, to get on the Hill as in this case they would have to get past walls that are six feet high and three feet thick. 
The minister is currently at a press conference and will be speaking later in the House.  
Let us talk about some of the statistics because there is a lot of support in the country for the legislation. 
In a recent Angus Reid poll 82% of Canadians approved the universal registration of rifles and shotguns; 72% in rural communities. 
The opposition is completely out of touch with Canadians.  
It appears all these statistics have no bearing on the opposition's memory. 
Some 78% of legally owned guns- 
An hon. member:
It is women, after all.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:
Yes, it is women after all. 
Some 1,400 lives are lost each year at a cost-and we talked about the medical cost-of $70 million. 
That is a burden on our health care system.  
When one hears certain members of the opposition, not to mention the loud protesters, one might think the government had not done anything in recent years to address the concerns of the gun lobby. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
The legislation passed by this House includes, in section 18, an unprecedented obligation on the part of the government to table draft regulations before each House of Parliament and to ensure that such regulations are reviewed by an appropriate parliamentary committee.  
We tabled regulations in this House on two occasions, first in November 1996 and then at the end of October 1997.  
In respect of the first set of regulations, the standing committee made a total of 39 recommendations. 
We were able to accept in whole or in part 38 of these 39 recommendations and to make amendments to the regulations to reflect those recommendations. 
When the statute was passing through the House, concerns were expressed about whether the statute provided appropriate opportunity to protect the constitutional and treaty rights of Canada's aboriginal peoples. 
Amendments were made to the statute to permit development of regulations respecting the matter in which any provision of the statute or the regulations applies to any of the aboriginal peoples of Canada and to adapt any such provision for the purpose of its application to aboriginal peoples.  
We developed a full set of regulations called the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada Adaptation Regulations. 
Both the development and implementation of these regulations have involved consultations and communication with a wide variety of native communities across the country.  
My former colleague, Mr. Anawak from the Northwest Territories, stated that it does not prevent our native people from putting food on the table, nor does it take away their guns; it simply means that they must register them. 
They still can keep their guns.  
More recently we have made more adjustments and accommodations. 
There was concern about our forms. 
We engaged focus groups and held consultations with interest groups. 
We revised the forms extensively and in a way that improves their acceptability to all concerned.  
There has been concern raised again from the same circles about certain categories of individuals who were the victims of unintended consequences of the legislation, particularly in respect of some categories of restricted firearms. 
The minister has indicated that an amnesty will be available to provide additional time for those persons to bring themselves into compliance with the statute.  
Yesterday the minister postponed the implementation of this program for 60 days to address the suggestion from law enforcement organizations that more time would ensure more complete data input and thus enhance public security.  
This whole legislation has to do with public security. 
We want to make sure that firearm users have the required permits and that, before they obtain such permits, they can demonstrate that they are responsible, law-abiding citizens, that they were never involved in criminal activities, and that they have received at least some basic training in the safe handling of firearms.  
Moreover, in order to better control the illegal movement of firearms and to provide better tools to police officers when they conduct criminal investigations or try to settle family disputes, all firearms will be registered by the year 2003.  
These are major public initiatives that relate to public security and that are applied in a customized and responsible manner to all Canadians. 
As my colleague, Mr. Rock, indicated, Bill C-68 has to do with the kind of country in which we want to live. 
It has to do with the kind of society we want for ourselves and for our families. 
Passing that legislation means our lifestyle and values will be determined by all Canadians, and not by the gun lobby.  
Firearms cause more than three deaths daily in Canada. 
The rate of mortality from gunshot wounds varies among provinces and territories, ranging from 5.7 to 21.2 per 100,000 people. 
The cost of the consequences for the improper use of firearms in Canada has been estimated at $6.6 billion per year.  
The official opposition leader spoke a lot about making changes to the Criminal Code. 
The Firearms Act is part of an overall strategy of this government for safer communities. 
It is one piece of the puzzle. 
This includes changes to the youth justice system, to crime prevention, to victims assistance and the setting up of a DNA data bank. 
We believe that all those together will lead to safer homes and safer cities.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the myths, the misleading of the public continues even in that speech, a couple of years after the bill was passed.  
For example, one of the things the minister trotted out is that large numbers of people out there support Bill C-68. 
She quoted a poll from Angus Reid in which 82% of the people contacted support gun control. 
What she neglected to say, and this is a key point, is that when people find out what the gun control measures that this government has put in place are, the support drops to less than 45%.  
The government has given the impression, which I am sure is just pure politics, that it is doing something wonderful for society by bringing in a gun registration scheme that is already costing $200 million, two and a half times the original projected cost, and will probably by the government's own figures cost $1 billion by the year 2015.  
Another thing that she trotted out is that there are over 1,000 lives lost in regard to this but she neglects to mention that there is no connection between this registration scheme and any way that the number would be reduced. 
The Liberals always trot out these figures in some attempt to convince the public that what they are doing is going to reduce that number.  
She then goes into a description of the form, a form that has been described by their own members as being no more complex than the Income Tax Act. 
She describes this piece of paper. 
What she does not tell us is how laying this piece of paper beside one's gun is going to reduce crime. 
Nowhere in the entire world is there documented evidence that this reduces crime. 
She neglects to say that when she describes this.  
My question for her comes from her very own user group that has said there is going to be a 50% error rate in regard to this registration scheme. 
The police are asking for this. 
If there is going to be an error rate, at what level will the error rate be acceptable?  
The reason this system has been delayed for the fourth time is because the government cannot make it work and it will never work. 
At what level would she accept this error rate that she described to be?  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to quote from the hon. member himself about how he thinks that the American system is the best system in the world and how proud he is that we should have the same type of system in this country. 
Thank God we do not have the same system in this country.  
As far as the error rate, one of the reasons we are delaying the implementation of this is to make sure that there will be no errors in the system.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary made reference to the American system. 
I presume she does not realize that there is no monolithic, all-encompassing legal system in the United States governing firearms.  
The District of Columbia for example has the most stringent firearms regulations in all of the western world, much more stringent than anything she and her government are proposing in this bill. 
It also has the highest rate of firearms homicides in the western world. 
It is 80 per 100,000 if anyone can believe it. 
This is in a strictly regulated environment.  
In the wide open state of North Dakota where anyone over the age of 14 can possess and use unsupervised almost any type of firearm, the homicide rate per 100,000 is roughly equal to that of Japan, 1.5.  
I wonder if she is even aware of these circumstances. 
Has she done any sort of study of gun control legislation as it pertains to the United States and around the world? 
I wonder how she would explain these anomalies which seem to indicate there are factors more important than mere possession of firearms or registration of firearms in firearms homicides.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:
Mr. Speaker, speaking of statistics, the murder rate with guns in the United States is 10 times higher than it is in this country. 
Let us get the statistics right. 
Gun death and injury rates are higher in western Canada and rural areas because of the use of firearms. 
There is also a direct link- 
An hon. member:
Answer the question.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:
You are not listening. 
You don't want to hear the answer.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order please. 
It is very difficult for the Chair to hear the answer in light of the noise in the chamber. 
Perhaps members might restrain themselves so all hon. members can hear the answer of the parliamentary secretary which I know will be very brief.  
Mr. Randy White:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there no requirement whatsoever in this House for a member opposite to answer the questions directly?  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am sure hon. members will want to be able to hear whatever answer is given. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:
Mr. Speaker, thank you. 
I suppose they are listening.  
There is a direct link between access to firearms and firearms death and injury. 
This comes from statistics collected all over the world. 
If they are interested in having statistics, they are there, but the members of the official opposition are not interested in the statistics nor in the truth. 
They are interested in supporting a gun lobby that is using its power to come to the House and to tell us to support the official opposition in misinforming the Canadian public.  
Mr. Bob Kilger:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is such a large number of government members who wish to participate in this debate that I want to inform you and the entire House that we will be splitting our time in subsequent rounds.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Deputy Speaker:
Is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
An hon. member:
No. 
The Deputy Speaker:
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, gun control legislation, it will be recalled, is legislation that we supported.  
The primary goal of this legislation-and this is something I remember, having been a member of the Standing Committee on Justice at the time-was to reduce the number of incidents in which people going through a psychologically difficult period in their life come across a gun and turn it on themselves, with fatal or very serious results, having first in some cases fatally wounded members of their own family, their wife or children, or strangers.  
This extremely tragic kind of behaviour, attributable to temporary psychological distress, would not have taken place if a gun had not been available at that particular point in time.  
This is not the case with hunters or employees whose activities give them legitimate access to firearms. 
Statistics show that this kind of accident occurs when guns are stored, sometimes for many years, with ammunition nearby. 
The gun has not been used in ages. 
The original owner no longer uses it. 
In short, there was no need for the weapon to be available to anyone. 
Unfortunately, it was available at a particular and tragic point in time and was used to kill one or more people.  
Faced with legislation that could reduce this risk, that could save human lives, one could hardly do other than support the underlying principles.  
The then Minister of Justice introduced a bill in the House the very purpose of which was to reduce these risks, to save lives. 
Faced with these objectives and principles, the Bloc Quebecois could only agree with a bill that preserved human life, a very precious commodity.  
At the time, however, the Bloc Quebecois asked the Minister of Justice to make a number of amendments. 
An initial group of amendments was intended to ensure that hunters and members of shooting clubs were not unduly hindered by the legislation in the exercise of their sport. 
The Bloc Quebecois introduced a number of amendments.  
Some of them were accepted. 
The Bloc Quebecois' proposal, for example, that the costs of registration be low, was well received by the government, and the costs are very reasonable indeed. 
However, in the case of the Bloc's proposal that a hunter's failure to register be decriminalized, the government's response was less positive.  
The Bloc sought to have gun handling courses taken in the past recognized, and the bill permits this.  
In the end, the bill as amended got the support of the Bloc, first and foremost because of the principle of the value of human life and then because a number of amendments had smoothed the rough edges. 
Today, however, we are well past that situation. 
Regulations have been submitted to the Standing Committee on Justice and discussed. 
These regulations were introduced and tabled here in the House and are now part of the package permitting the legislation to be applied.  
In this regard, I would like to quote to you two paragraphs of the Bloc's dissenting opinion in the justice committee report on the proposed regulations introduced by the minister in connection with the Firearms Act, and I quote: 
Representatives of industry, hunters and gun clubs all complained that they had not really been given the time to prepare properly. 
Moreover, even though some witnesses had devoted hours to putting together briefs as best they might, in many cases as volunteers, and had submitted them to the Committee Clerk, the briefs were never distributed to the Committee members because there was no time to have them translated into both official languages. 
It is attitudes like this on the part of the federal government that undermine the credibility of elected representatives and institutions in the eyes of the people.  
I will finish the quote: 
While the Bloc Québécois supports the concept of gun control and endorses the Committee's recommendations, it strongly deplores the fact that the disgraceful haste insisted on by the government and the Committee's Liberal majority has cast doubt on the quality of these regulations and put at risk the support of all Canadians and Quebeckers, which will be indispensable in the near future for the implementation of such an important piece of legislation.  
We have indeed got to that point. 
We are faced with cost overruns, unmet timetables, things that had been anticipated and with which the Bloc Quebecois cannot agree.  
But, as I read the motion put to us by the Reform Party, I see that it swings the pendulum totally in the other direction. 
We are in favour of the principle of the legislation. 
The Reform Party has never been in favour of the principle of the legislation, and that is where our paths diverge.  
Consequently, we cannot be in agreement with the Reform Party motion, although we continue to strongly disagree with the way the Minister of Justice is currently proceeding with implementation of this legislation.  
I offer one example: believe it or not, they are calling for volunteer auditors. 
The business auditors designated by the director are volunteers who will be responsible for checking business inventories and all transfers to and from those inventories.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to add my voice of concern to the direction in which this government is leading this country.  
I am going to ask a question at the beginning of this debate. 
Why are we debating this issue today when there should be other issues that are much more important in this country? 
We have had politics enter the area of justice and because of that the government is putting the whole country at risk.  
Why do I say that this is politics?  
People are asking me ``What will it accomplish?''  
I have to be honest with them. 
I cannot read the mind of the government, but I observe, as we look at this legislation, that this government is trying to create the impression that it is doing something wonderful for society by introducing a gun registration scheme. 
The government is equating this gun registration scheme with reducing crime in society.  
When we scratch the surface, when we look underneath, we realize that there is nothing there. 
Countries have tried this around the world.  
The government has not even answered the question that I have asked many times. 
The government cannot do it. 
It flies right at the very heart of democracy and debate. 
This is a very good example of what is wrong with this country.  
The demonstration that is going to take place this afternoon demonstrates, just like it did in Vancouver, that we can demonstrate all we want but our government does not listen. 
It ploughs ahead in the face of contradictory facts with legislation that will not work.  
I want to emphasize it. 
They have been deceived by their own government into believing that gun control is crime control and that it will somehow make our lives safer.  
There are several myths that have been spread about by the Liberals. 
Once people find out the truth about them, the support for the registration drops dramatically.  
The hon. parliamentary secretary quoted the statistic that 82% of Canadians support this. 
She did not finish the story. 
When the polling company asks them whether they would support it if the costs are $200 million, as they now are, rather than $85 million, or when they rise to $1 billion whether they would still support it, the support goes way down. 
It becomes a minority of people. 
That is hidden.  
The government always creates the impression that this is supported by the public, but it is not. 
Once the public finds out the true facts it drops dramatically.  
One of the myths that is spread is that it is going to be cost effective. 
It is not.  
Originally we were told that this was going to cost $85 million. 
That number disappeared a long time ago. 
In fact the budget for this year is over $133 million and that is just for the upfront costs. 
That is not for the hidden costs of all the other departments, what the provinces have to spend and the cost that is probably well and beyond that. 
Also, the year previous it was $67 million. 
That is $200 million in just the last couple of years.  
Then the government goes on to tell us that it is going to take $50 million or $60 million per year to maintain the system. 
By the government's own numbers that is $1 billion by the year 2015.  
We would rather have $50 million or $60 million to fight organized crime, which is a big problem. 
Target the criminal, not the law-abiding citizen''.  
We would rather have that facility available to us''.  
If we ask them whether they would rather have $50 million or $60 million spent compensating victims of crime, or victims of the HIV blood scandal that we had in this country and is still being debated, there is no doubt as to where they would spend that $50 million or $60 million.  
That needs to be debated in this House. 
When people find out about this registration scheme they would rather have the money spent elsewhere. 
If they were asked whether they would rather have $50 million or $60 million spent fighting child pornography or child prostitution, guess what they would say.  
The government claims it does not have money for many of these very important things and yet it spends it on a registration scheme that is soon going to cost us $1 billion.  
They would rather have the money spent combating family violence. 
When asked if they would rather $50 million or $60 million be put into police resources so that they can investigate all the unsolved murders and sex offences, guess what the public says.  
Today in British Columbia they are short $15 million which translates into 300 policemen on the street. 
They are short that much in order to provide the proper law enforcement resources in that province alone, and this exists across the country. 
Instead we put money into a bureaucratic scheme so that every gun owner can put a piece of paper beside his or her gun.  
This defies common sense. 
This is ridiculous and the public is fed up with it. 
There are so many myths associated with this that need to be dispelled. 
One is the cost and the other is the that the public supports this.  
Not only does Bill C-68 not accomplish anything, it does the exact opposite of what is intended. 
It takes resources and money from areas where it could be much better spent as I have just explained and puts it into forming more big government. 
It also takes police off the street. 
It takes away police resources and puts it into an area where it is much more needed.  
We do not need this. 
We need to have our police on the street and a registration scheme ties up the police behind their desks, not out on the street where they would do a lot more good. 
When the public realizes that it would do the opposite of what is intended, of what the government has said, the support for this drops dramatically.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I suggest this is a kind of issue where there should be a free vote in the House of Commons, where we could have the reflection of the great diversity of this country.  
The Reform Party has talked for a long time about more free votes in the House of Commons, reflecting the diversity of its constituents. 
Can he assure us at this time that there will be a free vote on this issue in the Reform Party so that we can see that reflection and diversity in the Reform caucus? 
It has talked about that for years. 
I remember those promises very well. 
I have not seen that promise reflected in the House of Commons since its members were elected to this place. 
I wonder whether on this issue, which is not really an ideological issue per se, this might be an example of a free vote in the Reform Party of Canada.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:
Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy that I point out to the member that we had a free vote on Bill C-68 in this House and we were roundly criticized by the NDP which did not have a free vote on this. 
We did. 
We had a free vote and our members are free to express that. 
They can represent their constituents. 
In fact, we go beyond that. 
We would like to see a lot more democracy in this country.  
I remind the member that he has been going around the country saying we should get rid of the Senate and he has joined together with a Liberal member of parliament from Ontario to do that. 
Unfortunately that would not improve the democracy in this country. 
We need to have a Senate that has some free votes and some accountability and is not appointed by the prime minister.  
We go well beyond what this member is saying and we truly want to democratize this institution. 
Those demonstrators who are out there today show very clearly one of the problems we have with this country and that is that when people express themselves they are not being listened to by this government. 
I think it should be of major concern to this member here that the people of Canada cannot express themselves and let their will be known.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 1 the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville told Alberta radio listeners that Canada should look to the United States for leadership on guns. 
He was asked a specific question about the American practice of allowing people to carry concealed weapons. 
He told the host and listeners: ``I think we should take a look at their experience there. 
I think they are ahead of us on that''.  
They talk about it on their newscasts like it is a car accident. 
I cannot believe the Reform Party would hold up the American gun culture as an example for Canada to emulate. 
Every day Canadians watch in horror as American television beams yet another firearm tragedy into our homes.  
How many children have to die before the Reform Party realizes that the United States is not the example Canadians want us to follow? 
How long will it take for him to realize and how long will it take for his colleagues to realize that these are not Canadian values?  
The other question I want to ask is how can grown men, and they seem to be mostly men, get so upset about our wanting to regulate a lethal commodity in our society?  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:
Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting how members opposite cleverly manipulate the discussion in the House to try to show that what they are doing is so wonderful for society. 
It becomes quite clear that they are trying to re-engineer society to get people to think that they are thinking in some way of what they are doing here.  
The focus of the discussion today is a registration scheme.  
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:
Mr. Speaker, maybe we should wait for a moment for them to be quiet so they can listen to the answer.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The member would not want to wait too long, his time is about to expire.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:
Mr. Speaker, I point out to the member in answer to her question that we need to do research around the world on what is happening and the experience. 
That is the point I made that she was quoting, that we have to look at what is happening around the world and the experience that people have had with registration around the world. 
We find out that it has not worked anywhere, so why should we try to spend hundreds of millions of dollars here when it has not worked anywhere?  
Sexual assaults went down 86% when they did a certain experiment.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I start off by explaining that I am an active firearms owner and user. 
I am a trap and skeet shooter. 
I am not particularly good at it but I enjoy doing it.  
I am also a competitive pistol shooter. 
I am much better at that. 
Having said that, I say to the Liberals across the way and to everyone else that I support gun control. 
Gun control is good. 
We should have it in Canada. 
There is no question about that.  
Gun control is ensuring that international arms dealers do not operate out of our country. 
Gun control is about ensuring that criminals do not smuggle Uzis and AK-47s into this country. 
Gun control is about ensuring that terrorists cannot easily arm themselves with illegal weapons. 
Gun control is about getting firearms out of the hands of criminals. 
Gun control is desirable for the average Canadian, and I agree with it. 
But Bill C-68 is not about gun control.  
I have had a lot of people write to me. 
An overwhelming majority were opposed to this bill. 
Some were in favour. 
I spent as much time looking at their letters as I do with the others, perhaps even more. 
I know what a lot of the people opposed to it are going to say but I want to see what the people who are in favour in this bill have to say about it. 
One women said if it saves only one life is it not worth it. 
I am not going to brush that off. 
I am going to have a very serious look at that. 
If it saves even one life is it worth it? 
The figure that was going around at the time was $89 million. 
Later it went to $118.9 million. 
That figure is now quite low but that is the figure I worked with and looked at.  
In 1993, 1,354 lives were lost in some manner related to a firearm, suicide, homicide, accident, legal intervention, every means we can connect to a firearm. 
The same year I looked at those figures I found out from talking to a doctor in charge of the breast cancer detection program in British Columbia that 17,000 women would be diagnosed that year alone with breast cancer. 
Of those 5,400 would be terminal. 
I asked what results would that give. 
He said that statistically they could save 1,710 lives. 
That is 1,710 real lives saved, victims in this country, or some unknown percentage in some unknown way of 1,354 that has never been explained to us by the past justice minister or the present one. 
If this bill is about saving lives there are a lot better ways to spend the money.  
We have another consideration. 
There are going to be a lot of things talked about today. 
I want to hit on a couple of very specific points. 
There is a challenge by the province of Alberta that has gone to court and is complete. 
We are waiting for the decision of that court challenge. 
The government is spending a lot of money on that court challenge. 
I might add that the province of Alberta is supported by the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and the territories.  
When they say there is a lot of support out there, yes there is. 
I think it is because of misinformation. 
But that aside, there is a lot of support out there. 
There is also a lot of resentment to this bill from individuals Canadians, from groups of Canadians and from entire provincial governments. 
There is a lot of opposition to this as well. 
That should be a clue to the government that even if it wants to keep this bill it should perhaps at a very minimum look at it and see if there is some alternative to some of the aspects of it. 
Even without the most objectionable parts of it there is some alternative to what it is proposing to do.  
Under the Alberta court challenge it is anticipated, and this is from fairly high up and not our opinion, that the federal government is going to lose that challenge. 
The decision will likely read that the federal government does not have the right to regulate private property. 
If that happens what it will do is not only strike down the registration provisions of Bill C-68, it will strike down the registration of handguns as well.  
If there is support for Bill C-68 from people who want to see sporting rifles and shotguns registered, can we imagine the outcry from these people if the actions of the government, albeit intending to support the desires of those people, inadvertently causes the loss of the registration of handguns? 
I think the government would end up losing ground rather than gaining. 
In light of that it might want to reconsider.  
The government, by claiming that the bill would reduce crime, has played a very cruel hoax on Canadians by providing them with a false sense of security and possibly reducing vigilance against criminal attack. 
The government claims that Bill C-68 will make our homes and streets safer but the legislation does absolutely nothing whatsoever to justify that claim.  
The money the government is wasting on Bill C-68 could be spent far more effectively on disease prevention, detection and cures; on policing costs; on establishing DNA databanks to aid the police in apprehending and convicting violent criminals; on post-secondary education for young people who are inheriting a debt of two decades of wasteful program spending, which I might add can be compared very closely with this bill and the amount of money it will cost.  
Bill C-68 is not gun control. 
It is a phenomenal waste of money. 
If anything, it actually helps criminals by diverting police activities from their apprehension.  
The Canadian Police Association, the frontline police officers, not the politically appointed chiefs of police, who deal directly with criminals and criminal situations are totally opposed to the bill.  
If the government's intentions were good, now is the time to correct the outcome. 
What the government intended may not be the way it will come out. 
I call on the government to rescind Bill C-68 and replace it with legislation that cracks down on the criminal misuse of firearms. 
If the intention is good that is great.  
In the first speech I ever made in the House of Commons I said, and sincerely meant it, that I was not here to oppose the government for opposition sake. 
If the government does something right I will be the first to congratulate it. 
If the government comes out with a bill that I do not happen to agree with, I will speak out on it and try to suggest alternatives to make it a better bill.  
I have done that in committee. 
I have worked with government officials not to try to expose what they are doing and say they are a bunch of whatever but rather to say what I believe the problems are and to give a justifiable and valid alternative.  
There are alternatives. 
The government should not blindside itself by saying that everything it does it automatically right. 
It would be far better to say that everything it does it means to be right but sometimes it will have to make some changes along the way.  
I believe this is one of those times. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat puzzled. 
I do not understand the contradiction in Reform Party policy when it comes to community safety. 
I do not understand why it would oppose crime control Bill C-68. 
Why does it want to oppose crime control legislation that will guarantee the safety of our communities?  
The bill takes into consideration the interests of law-abiding citizens who own guns and the community at large. 
It strikes a balance between those who have and those who want to be protected.  
I do not understand how the member could stand in the House to oppose gun control legislation and crime prevention Bill C-68.  
Victims groups in his constituency, the majority of people in his community and across the country, chief of police organizations, police associations and health organizations were involved in the development of the registry part of Bill C-68.  
On a number of occasions his own party has indicated the need to control the use of firearms. 
Back in 1994 it passed a motion that if elected a Reform government would introduce legislation by which the criminal misuse of firearms would be severely punished.  
What happened between 1994 and 1998? Why is the Reform Party now falling into the trap of special interest groups and lobby organizations? 
Why is it not defending the interests of its own constituencies and those of victims? 
Why are Reformers not standing up for the rights of those who wanted them to stand up for their rights, for those who have written to them over and over again to tell them to support Bill C-68? 
Why are they going with special interest groups and against the will and interests of the community at large?  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
Mr. Speaker, that was a very interesting little spiel from the hon. member. 
I am sure he has been taking lessons from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
He said that the bill was about crime control. 
That is a myth that I cannot believe they believe. 
Criminals are the problem. 
By definition criminals break the law. 
Why does the government think a registration program law-abiding citizens have to comply with will solve crimes?  
Can we imagine the bank robber on his way to the bank saying ``Gee, we had better not rob the bank today because I haven't registered this rifle?'' 
When was the last time somebody robbed a bank with a rifle?  
Crime control, give me a break. 
If the member wants to talk about what we are doing today then at least he should make some sensible remarks.  
The hon. member said that the chiefs of police were against us. 
I acknowledge that. 
Politically appointed chiefs of police are onside with the government that appoints people. 
What a surprise. 
I do not know if it was intentional or not, but he was wrong when he said that police associations were in favour of it. 
They are not. 
The Regina police refused to support the RCMP in a request to register firearms. 
The Canadian Police Association that covers police from one end of the country to the other, frontline police who do the work, is opposed to the legislation.  
He talked about my constituents. 
I surveyed my constituents with a question that firearms owners challenged me on. 
They asked why I was being so neutral, why I was not being stronger and more supportive in the way I asked questions. 
I told them it had to be an absolutely neutral, fair question which we had designed for us. 
I got the biggest response on that survey of any householder survey I have ever sent out.  
An hon. member:
Table it.  
Mr. Jim Gouk:
I will give the member the figures on that. 
Ninety per cent of respondents opposed the bill after being asked a totally neutral question. 
I am representing my constituents. 
I would suggest to the hon. member that he has a lot of backbenchers over there who are not representing their constituents.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I regret to inform the House that the time for questions and comments has expired.  
Prior to the speech of the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville, on the special agreed order in respect of rotation it was the turn of the New Democratic Party to offer a speech followed by the Conservative Party. 
That unfortunately did not happen.  
Is there consent to revert to those two speeches so we may clear this up today and then allow government members to follow since the official opposition has had its first two speakers? 
Would the House agree to revert to allow these two 10 minute speeches to follow in the usual case?  
In effect we started a new session yesterday and members may not be accustomed to the usual practices. 
I hope there would be agreement to do this. 
Is it agreed?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I start by thanking the House for its indulgence on this matter. 
I appreciate the effort of my colleagues. 
It is perhaps a good juncture to see the House agree to allowing me and the Conservative Party to speak to this issue.  
We have had probably an hour and a half of very partisan and very heated debated on the opposition motion. 
Of course the history of gun control and registration is not new. 
Since 1877 Canada has restricted the use of some firearms to protect public policy. 
Since 1968 Canada has classified weapons as prohibited, restricted and non-restricted. 
In 1977-and this has been referred to by members in the debate-an act was introduced which created the firearms acquisition certificate. 
For a long time there has been debate in the House-this is not a new issue-about how firearms are to be controlled and whether or not we need gun registration.  
Many Canadians have opposed the bill. 
When it was introduced in the House last year there was tremendous debate. 
Today we revisited much of that debate. 
We have to be clear that although the motion speaks to registration there is a rally opposed to Bill C-68 on Parliament Hill today. 
Much of the debate is focusing in reality on that bill.  
This piece of legislation has concerned many Canadians on both sides of the issue. 
I have listened to many convincing arguments by Canadians and by their representatives in the House who oppose Bill C-68 and who oppose registration.  
In my caucus the member for Churchill has been eloquent in presenting to me as the justice critic the interests and concerns of her constituents about the legislation. 
The member for Yukon in the caucus has told eloquent stories about aboriginal women in her community who use firearms as part of their daily lives and see in many cases Bill C-68 and the registration of firearms as an imposition on them and their historic way of life.  
On the other hand-and this reflects the diversity in the country-I have heard from the member for Burnaby-Douglas about the concerns of his constituents in a very urban riding who say that gun control is necessary for them to feel safe in their homes and in their streets.  
We are not talking about Sarajevo. 
We are talking about Canada.  
If there is one thing Canadians expect from the House, it is that we take this most serious issue and do not play politics with it, that we take this most serious issue and reflect the concerns of Canadians on both sides.  
The whole issue of gun control came from well-intentioned people. 
Its opposition is from well-intentioned members. 
When the Minister of Justice introduced the legislation I do not think he was trying to anger or that he did not take into account the concerns of rural Canadians and aboriginal Canadians. 
I do not think members of the opposition party when they were first elected and opposed this bill did so simply to play politics.  
I think it reflects the real divisions in this country. 
We have always suggested that the legislation needed to be reviewed. 
We needed to take into account the aboriginal community, the rural and urban Canadians and find a way in this great country in our history of consensus building to meet the needs of all these individuals.  
At the beginning of this debate the hon. Leader of the Opposition said that the Reform Party came here in part to make parliament more democratic. 
He called for more free votes. 
We in the NDP have for a long time argued that there has to be a different way to deal with very contentious issues. 
We have called for the abolition of the Senate but that is not the purpose of this debate today so I will not go into it. 
Today on this issue we will demonstrate the commitment of our party to the reformation of this institution and ask for a free vote. 
We will vote that way in this party reflecting the diversity of Canadians on this contentious issue, reflecting the wishes of our constituents and reflecting our history on this issue.  
Let us not forget that when this law was introduced there were nine members of the New Democratic Party in this House. 
Since then more than half of this caucus is newly elected. 
We spoke to our constituents about their concerns. 
I have given some examples of what those concerns have been. 
We will be voting freely on this motion before the House.  
I do wish that the opposition motion called for a review of the firearms legislation. 
I do wish that the implementation by the government had proceeded in a better way. 
At the end of the day when the vote is called, we will vote according to that.  
That being said, there are different merits on different parts of the legislation. 
As I have indicated I would be happier had both the government and the opposition attempted to find a way to change the legislation to make it accommodate all of the interests in the country. 
I believe that we can truly reflect the interests of Canadians in that way. 
I call upon the members of this House to do so. 
Questions were put to the Reform Party whether there would be a free vote on this issue. 
The Leader of the Opposition questioned the government, will there be a free vote on this issue? 
Well, there will be for some of us. 
I throw that out as an answer.  
I suggest again that the people who live in parts of this country that have genuine concerns about firearms ought to be respected, but so too and not at the expense of other Canadians.  
We in this country have always found a way to compromise on the most difficult and contentious issues. 
We look to our parliamentarians and we look to our leaders for that compromise. 
We have proposed for a long time a review of the legislation, that we travel the country and hear the concerns of Canadians which I think is the Canadian way.  
I thank the House again for its indulgence in allowing me my turn to speak.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to address the hon. member with a bit of historical information about the debates on this bill back in 1994-95. 
There were in fact great efforts made to make the bill better, make it acceptable to all concerned. 
There were some 200 amendments proposed both by opposition members and by members on the government side. 
The government stonewalled almost all of them. 
There was no consideration given to them. 
There was no compromise, a sort of take no prisoners attitude.  
I would ask the member if he feels that the total rejection of more than 200 amendments really represents an effort to govern or if it is merely an effort to steamroll.  
Mr. Peter Mancini:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
They are enlightening to me as a member who has been in this House for a year.  
One of the things I am going to reflect on and honestly one of the things I have learned here is that sometimes amendments are put forward in good spirit and sometimes they are put forward for purely political purposes to filibuster. 
I am learning that. 
It is one of the things that I am learning about perhaps the darker side of the rules in parliament.  
When the member asks me whether that was stonewalling or whether it was a poor attempt to govern, I do not know what those amendments were in fairness. 
I do not know what they reflected. 
More than 200 certainly means that they were doing their job I suppose. 
They were reviewed by the justice committee. 
My experience on that committee to date has been that oftentimes parties seize on a particular issue and will sometimes play politics with it. 
Sadly, I was not here but I thank the hon. member for his history lesson. 
I unfortunately cannot determine whether or not those amendments were in good faith or not.  
I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice speak earlier. 
She indicated that during that debate all kinds of amendments were accepted. 
I do not know how many must have been put forward to the government. 
Some were accepted. 
Obviously 200 were rejected. 
It does not sound to me like the best way to do business though.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member which I would like to preface.  
I would like to ask the member whether he really believes that this piece legislation, formerly known as Bill C-68, is more about taxation than gun control. 
I would ask the member to share his thoughts with respect to whether he thinks that registering the long rifles of innocent deer hunters, duck hunters and farmers will have any effect on deterring the criminal use of firearms. 
I think ultimately it will not and the excessive registration costs which are rumoured to be in the area of $300 million to as high as $1 billion are far too excessive for our law-abiding citizens.  
If we really want to deter the criminal use of firearms in this country, I would ask the hon. member to answer the question of whether this $60 million to be utilized on an annual basis would be better used to put more police on the street, to actually seriously fight crime in a real way.  
I also have a more specific question for the NDP in general. 
In 1997 in the riding of Kings-Hants the candidate actually painted himself as being anti Bill C-68 while the member for Halifax and the NDP leader painted themselves as pro Bill C-68. 
Where is the position of the NDP with respect to Bill C-68?  
Mr. Peter Mancini:
Mr. Speaker, there were many questions but I will answer the first question first and then in the order in which they came.  
The question was, do I think the $60 million might be put to better use. 
I suppose it depends on one's perspective. 
In the last session of this House before I was a member of parliament there was a great deal of talk and discussion in Cape Breton, where we have a staggering rate of unemployment, that the gun control registration centre would be placed in my riding creating upwards of 100 jobs. 
That was a pretty enticing argument.  
I suppose from the perspective of a member of parliament who might possibly have some of his constituents put to work in a gun registration centre in an area of high unemployment it is not too much money. 
On the other hand if it is going to stay here in Ottawa, maybe that changes my perspective a little bit and I do not think it is going to be located in Cape Breton.  
Could the money be put to better use? 
There is no shortage of money in this country- 
The Deputy Speaker:
The time has expired.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its indulgence. 
It is always an honour to follow my colleague from the New Democratic Party, a learned counsel, justice critic and fellow Nova Scotian. 
He has given a view from his perspective on this particular debate and I hope to add my humble remarks.  
With respect to the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt, I am pleased to pledge our party's support for this particular motion before the House. 
It reaffirms the position taken by the hon. Jean Charest in the last parliament, in the last election and the position of our party throughout this debate, the unwavering opposition to this ill conceived long gun registration.  
The focus here should not waver. 
The emphasis here is on long guns.  
One of the key commitments I made to the constituents of Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough was that I would continue to oppose this piece of legislation. 
It is ineffective and unproven mandatory gun registration. 
The legislation concentrates and targets law-abiding citizens as opposed to criminals who would be using firearms.  
Bill C-68 clearly does not approach and does not affect the root causes of crime. 
One of the first motions I tabled in this House last September was to achieve the very goal which this particular motion sets out to achieve.  
This motion is very timely. 
Obviously when we hear the cries of thousands and thousands of law-abiding gun owners who have assembled here on the hill today, there appears to be some opposition to what the government is going to do with this piece of legislation.  
Others have already detailed the specific problems with this particular act. 
Those problems were highlighted at the justice committee with the numerous amendments that were struck down by the government. 
I would suggest they were useful, non-partisan amendments that were aimed at improving the act. 
If we cannot kill it, the very least we can do is try to improve it.  
In the past several weeks I have had the opportunity to personally meet a number of representatives from organizations in my home province of Nova Scotia, individuals such as Tony Rodgers of the Nova Scotia Wildlife Federation to review the negative impact that has already resulted from this act.  
Businesses in the province of Nova Scotia and like businesses in other provinces are going to be extremely negatively affected by the implementation of this legislation because, as we know, it is going to force businesses to subject themselves to an extremely bureaucratic, cumbersome registry system that is not going to impact on the criminal use of firearms.  
The Liberal government and its well intentioned allies I might add have attempted to sell this issue of firearms registration as a question of crime control and safety. 
It could not be any further from the truth.  
The Liberals have made it an issue of black and white: proponents of Bill C-68 support gun control whereas opponents of Bill C-68 oppose gun control. 
That is completely untrue. 
Let us make this perfectly clear. 
I do not think there is anyone in this House, anyone in the opposition, who has any opposition to gun control per se. 
This is about long gun registration.  
Firearms owners I know and meet on a regular basis are some of the most responsible in handling guns and the most responsible and supportive of effective safety measures when it comes to the handling of firearms.  
It came to light last spring that statistics used by the government to justify the mandatory registration of firearms were seriously flawed. 
This seems to me to be a convenient excuse for the government to dismiss the facts it does not like to hear. 
Is it any wonder that the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba and two territories have embarked on a challenge in the Supreme Court of Alberta to strike down Bill C-68.  
In fact this government played a part in implementing some of those pieces of legislation.  
Under this previous gun law, applicants were required to obtain firearms application certificates, FACs, which required them to take a gun course, undergo police checks and wait up to 28 days. 
Handguns were considered restricted weapons and owners were required to have ownership permits. 
Handgun permits were only issued to certified gun collectors and sports club members who were taking part in shooting competitions. 
Private ownership of most military assault weapons was banned or restricted. 
Those wanting to hunt were required to take mandatory hunting courses or required to take firearms handling safety courses.  
The previous law also included stringent storage and transportation regulations, making it an offence to breach these regulations.  
With all of these tough restrictions in place, what did the Liberal government then do upon assuming power? 
Did the Liberals evaluate the effectiveness of the law? 
No. They embarked on a new form of intrusive and restrictive gun registration which, I submit humbly, was a knee-jerk and emotionally driven reaction to tragic circumstances that occurred in this country.  
The Liberals have cited national opinion polls reporting overwhelming support from Canadians for this legislation. 
I wonder how many Canadians, particularly urban Canadians, really understand what the impact of this legislation will be. 
Would they be so supportive if the legislation was prefaced with the fact that Canadians already possess some of the most stringent gun control and registration laws?  
Perhaps these public opinion polls are of concern to some in the House, but the practicality here is that this legislation is not going to impact on the criminal use of firearms.  
The former minister of justice also promised that it was only going to cost $85 million, despite evidence from witnesses at the original justice committee hearing that put the price tag as high as $500 million.  
We have heard from all sorts of groups throughout this country, including aboriginal Canadians, predominately Canadians from the rural centres, who participate in perfectly legitimate legal activities involving the use of firearms such as hunting and target shooting. 
These people have overwhelmingly voiced their opposition to this act.  
Since the former minister's promises, we are now coming to the conclusion that the Canadian firearms centre and its administration charges are going to exceed $133.9 million to this point in time and we have not yet seen a single gun registered.  
The justice department will not deny the reports that are appearing in the media that this is going to escalate to the point where it may exceed $500 million. 
For this reason I wrote to the auditor general last week to urge his office to conduct a money for value audit on the Canadian firearms centre and the divisions of the Department of Justice responsible for the implementation of this act. 
Canadians need to know why this money is being spent in this fashion.  
I question the government's priorities. 
This amount of money could easily be spent on front line policing, as was suggested earlier. 
It could be spent on homes for battered women. 
It could be spent on all sorts of justice initiatives, including the minister's much awaited and much ballyhooed young offender changes that we are anxiously anticipating.  
I would also suggest that outside the area of justice, the money could be spent in the area of compensating hepatitis C victims and compensating public service employees who have been long awaiting compensation.  
Without any doubt, the priorities of this government have to be questioned. 
Why not focus on the root causes of violence? 
Why not use these resources in more effective ways?  
Time and time again we have seen this government switch its priorities at the last minute. 
In recent days we have seen its decision to delay this further. 
Why not take a hard look at what is taking place in this country with respect to this piece of legislation?  
Before I conclude I want to commend the NDP for its decision to have a free vote. 
Let us support this motion and replace Bill C-68 with anti-crime legislation, not anti-gun owner legislation.  
I would like to amend the motion by adding the following words to the main motion: 
; and that this House also urges the government to conduct a public, independent evaluation of the 1991 firearms legislation with respect to reducing firearm-related crime before it proceeds with any new firearms legislation.  
The Deputy Speaker:
May I ask the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough who the seconder of the motion is?  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
It is seconded by the hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This amendment would be acceptable, and it is certainly a good point as far as the official opposition is concerned. 
We are waiting to hear your decision as to whether or not this is acceptable within the parameters of the original motion.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Does the hon. member have any submissions to make on that point?  
Mr. Randy White:
We are waiting for you, Mr. Speaker. 
The Deputy Speaker:
I have considered the amendment and it is safe to say that the Chair has some concerns concerning the amendment, in that it appears to enlarge the scope of the original motion as moved.  
However, in the circumstances, the issue raised by the amendment is relevant to the main motion. 
It is an opposition day. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member of the Conservative Party. 
I certainly intend to wholeheartedly support the amendment and the motion.  
But we also recognize that the problem is not the gun, but rather the situation that precipitates what happens with the gun. 
That has long been recognized in a number of our communities.  
We are not willing to sacrifice the dollar usage for gun registration, which we in our constituency believe is faulty. 
We do not intend to imply that law-abiding citizens should be affected by this legislation.  
If I believed one iota that gun registration would lessen deaths I would be there a hundredfold.  
There has never been enough enforcement in this area. 
That is where the fault lies with gun registration and gun control.  
There needs to be greater gun control, not gun registration. 
There needs to be greater enforcement. 
The dollars should be utilized to ensure that there are better programs within communities and better support systems.  
I want to commend the hon. member for his amendment.  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I will respond very briefly.  
I thank the hon. member for her remarks. 
She knows of what she speaks. 
It is clearly a fact that it is not guns that kill people, it is the person pulling the trigger.  
It is aimed at putting a serial number on a gun, on an inanimate object. 
That is not going to prevent the object from killing or maiming a person if it falls into the wrong hands.  
Canadians, by their very nature, are transitory. 
Knowing where those weapons are, who houses them, who is in possession of them is going to be an absolute impossibility.  
As has been stated many times before, criminals are not going to participate in this registration system. 
The information is going to be inaccurate. 
Police officers are not going to be able to rely on the information with any degree of confidence. 
I suggest that this will create a false sense of security amongst the policing community and amongst Canadians generally.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough in his original speech went to great lengths to try to illustrate that Bill C-68 has nothing to do with crime control. 
Everybody, certainly every member of the opposition, is in support of gun control. 
The justice minister in a few moments is going to be on a tirade with a bunch of statistics. 
In anticipation of that and in anticipation of studies which quote that 82% of Canadians favour gun control, I want the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough to illustrate for the House how that is very misleading. 
It is not about gun registration, it is about the safe usage, storage and handling of firearms that Canadians are in favour.  
Mr. Peter MacKay:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
It is a rare opportunity to respond to a question in the presence of the Minister of Justice, in anticipation of what she is going to say.  
I am sure we are going to hear a great deal about the methodological approach of the government and the statistics that it has been using to justify this particular bill.  
However, the point is well made. 
The emphasis should be on the criminal use of weapons, not targeting those who are using guns for a legitimate purpose, recreational or otherwise. 
It should put the emphasis on what criminals are doing with their guns. 
This legislation does not do that.  
As the member of the NDP suggested, why not put those statistics into front line policing and into areas where the police will be able to enforce the current laws, rather than create a new cumbersome process that simply will not work?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this morning I spoke at a press conference and thanked Canadians for their ongoing support of our government's firearms control program.  
I specifically thanked CAVEAT, Victims of Violence International, La Fondation des victimes du 6 décembre, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and the family members of victims who are here to ask the government to hold firm and implement its plan.  
I also took the opportunity to thank the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, municipalities, educators, child support agencies and the almost 700 member agencies of the coalition for gun control which have been tireless supporters of this program. 
These are the people who have learned through painful experience the terrible tragedies that can occur when firearms are not safely stored, when firearms fall into the hands of children, when police are asked to deal with a domestic violence call and have no knowledge of whether firearms are at play or when an illegal firearms industry develops with inadequate controls in place.  
Let me make one thing clear. 
We will not be deterred by inflammatory and irresponsible rhetoric.  
The vast majority of Canadians support gun control. 
Support for gun control today, including support for registration, is at its highest level ever, at 80% in some polls. 
Today a majority of gun owners support gun control. 
Gun control will be implemented on December 1.  
Canadians are law abiding citizens. 
I understand that when angry, people can make outlandish and even irresponsible statements but I know the vast majority of gun owners respect and obey the law. 
So I say once again to those who demonstrate today that they have nothing to fear from me or from this government. 
My commitment is to ensure that gun control is implemented in the fairest and most efficient way possible.  
The Firearms Act is about building a culture of safety around the use of firearms. 
Through it we hope to achieve many things. 
Firearms registration and licensing of all gun owners will help keep firearms away from people who should not have them. 
It will encourage awareness on the part of gun owners of the essential responsibility they have for their firearms, including their safe use and the importance of safe storage and transportation.  
A central processing site is already in service in Miramichi, New Brunswick. 
All applications will go through there. 
Visits to the police will no longer be required. 
This will allow our police to spend their time and resources on police work and not on preliminary paperwork. 
Starting December 1 for a one time cost of $10 firearms owners will be able to register all their firearms. 
They will register on forms made simple after consultations with the firearms community.  
We have taken every step we can to ensure the registration and licensing of firearms in Canada is hassle free and easily affordable. 
I have every confidence that firearms owners, once they participate in the program, will discover that their concerns were groundless.  
Hunting is an activity that has been enjoyed by many Canadians for generations. 
To farmers firearms are needed to protect crops. 
Target shooting is a sport at which Canada excels internationally. 
Firearms for some are needed for sustenance and are part of a way of life. 
All these activities are legitimate and will not be hampered in any way by gun control.  
Our new Firearms Act is not about confiscation. 
Such fears were raised when gun control was first introduced in Canada in the 1970s. 
They are being raised again today but they are as groundless as they were then.  
Today's debate is essentially about values. 
Canadians have told us that they want effective gun control. 
Polling shows that a majority of Canadians in every province support the universal registration of firearms.  
Our government and our Prime Minister will stand with the Canadian police, victims of firearms crime and accidents, law abiding gun owners and all Canadians who care about safer communities.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to hear that the minister's heart is pure. 
I feel better already.  
She has gone to great lengths to tell us that there is nothing to fear in the legislation. 
I believe that she believes that. 
However, if she would look around the country she would find that even under existing legislation let alone the draconian stuff that is being proposed here, ordinary citizens are being harassed and guns are being confiscated without compensation.  
The hon. parliamentary secretary thinks this is a joke. 
I wonder if Darrell McKnight, head of the computer department at the University of New Brunswick, would think it was a joke. 
His home was invaded by not one but three police officers searching for a firearm which he had duly registered and had bought in good faith. 
It was a legally owned weapon. 
By order in council the previous justice minister had declared this was no longer a legal weapon. 
The police came when he was not at home. 
So please spare me this stuff about it is not a danger to us. 
Hon. Anne McLellan:
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the hon. member actually asked me a question but let me say to the individual in question that I have no knowledge of the situation involving the person named. 
If he has a concern in terms of the way the police discharged their duties, if he has a concern with the way the attorney general of the province of New Brunswick conducted himself, or if he has a concern with the way I as Attorney General of Canada conducted myself in relation to the specifics of that situation I would appreciate that individual getting in touch with me. 
I would be very happy to sit down with him and talk to him about his experience.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I myself am a firearm owner as well as a big-game hunter. 
I mention this because, unfortunately, there are still a few men who wonder what my involvement is in the debate on this issue, and I have been involved for a number of years. 
When I sat on the special committee on firearms in 1990, I was the only committee member with a FAC, or firearm acquisition certificate.  
Yesterday, for instance, I tuned in to an open-line program on an English-language station. 
The caller was saying ``This means I will have to pay $10 per firearm every year; it is going to cost me $60 a year for a permit.'' 
As you and I know, this is absolutely false. 
Once the firearms are registered, that is for life. 
As for the permit, it is good for five years. 
Why are all these falsehoods still being spread?  
I would like to know, first of all, if we will indeed have to pay such a tab and, second, how it got to be so high. 
If this is not true, I think that a public denial is in order.  
I would like the minister to clarify this for us today.  
Hon. Anne McLellan:
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very important point and that is those who choose for whatever reason to propagate misinformation and misrepresentations surrounding the new federal gun licensing and registration program.  
I can assure the hon. member that wherever possible I take the opportunity to rectify those errors. 
But I think all of us in this House who are people of good faith who are either legitimate gun owners such as the hon. member or those of us who are not gun owners support the right of legitimate gun owners to possess their weapons.  
It is our obligation to engage those who would lie and misrepresent the truth. 
We must work with all Canadians together to ensure we have a degree of public safety and security that all Canadians have told us over and over again they want and they deserve.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the resolution we are debating today contains a type of misleading information that we have come to expect from the opponents of this legislation.  
Before I proceed I want to emphasize that Canadians understand that the Firearms Act and the amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada in Bill C-68 are an investment in crime prevention which will preserve the culture of safety in Canada. 
I can tell all members that as former chairman of the Waterloo regional police I know this is correct and is very important.  
It is not a surprise that 82% of all Canadians support the registration of all guns. 
Seventy-two percent of rural Canadians approve of registration. 
Seventy-eight percent of respondents say they approve of the act and almost half the gun owners approve of the Firearms Act as well. 
There is massive support for this legislation.  
Our opponents who are clearly driving the resolution before this House today are a small minority of special interests out of touch with the main street Canada on this issue. 
It is most unfortunate but typical.  
The resolution suggests that the government should be condemned for its refusal to replace Bill C-68. 
Let us review for a moment the background of how this legislation came to be. 
It was introduced in the House of Commons on February 14, 1995. 
Through successive debates including an extensive list of amendments brought to the bill in committee and in debate on third reading the bill was finally approved in December 1995.  
The Firearms Act contains unprecedented provisions in section 118 which require that all regulations under the Firearms Act be tabled before both houses of parliament on the same day and that each of these regulations shall be referred by the Chamber to an appropriate committee which may conduct public hearings in respect to the regulations.  
Two major sets of regulations were processed in this manner with the first set being tabled in November 1996, the second in October 1997. 
The standing committee reviewing the first set of regulations made 39 recommendations, 38 of which were accepted in whole or in part. 
In respect to the second set of regulations the standing committee again made 39 recommendations, 35 of which were accepted in whole or in part. 
My point in this brief review is to ask the opposition why in view of the extensive parliamentary involvement in both the legalization and the regulations and in view of the number of changes and accommodations which were made as the legislation passed through the House would we even consider replacing Bill C-68. 
Why would we want to do that? 
Let us remember that this is legislation that enjoys the support of 82% of Canadians.  
Those who support this motion would have us believe that this legislation does nothing to address the criminal misuse of firearms. 
Opposition members may wish to consult the Criminal Code in this respect. 
A significant number of offences in the code were modified to carry a minimum punishment of imprisonment for four years. 
These Criminal Code offences were found under the headings of causing death by criminal negligence, manslaughter, attempt to commit murder, causing bodily harm with intent, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, robbery and extortion.  
Other offences are found for a variety of criminal offences including activities such as weapons trafficking, possession for the purpose of weapons trafficking, automatic firearms importing and exporting, knowing it is unauthorized, and tampering with the serial number of a firearm.  
We were very attentive to criminal activities in formulating the offence provisions of Bill C-68.  
Members of the opposition, if they really took the time to study the issue, would also find that there have been a number of appeals of the four year minimum sentences that have taken place over the past two years. 
The opposition in its resolution suggests the government should abandon the policy of firearms registration. 
There are a number of excellent reasons why the registration of firearms is a good idea. 
Let me address a few of these at this time.  
Every year an estimated 70,000 firearms are sold privately in Canada. 
At the same time a large number are stolen, lost or otherwise unaccounted for, for firearms circulate within Canada. 
The registration of all guns, rifles and shotguns as well as handguns will contribute to a reduction in the grey and the black market sales of guns and provide protection for both sellers and purchasers.  
The licensing of firearms users is one of the central features of this legislation. 
Only people who are responsible and have not been within the past five years convicted of Criminal Code offences will be eligible to use firearms. 
If they have been convicted of an offence involving violence against a person, an offence involving criminal activity, the contravention of the Food and Drugs Act or the Narcotic Control Act or if they have been treated for a mental illness that involves violence or other behaviour involving violence, then they will be caught by the licensing system.  
People who sell guns should know to whom they are selling. 
If the person buying the gun has a licence there is some reasonable assurance that the person is a law abiding, responsible person.  
Further, persons with licences will have completed and passed the Canadian firearm safety course and should have at least the basics in respect of the safe handling and use of firearms.  
In summary, registration contributes to public safety by keeping guns away from people who should not have them. 
Many of the lost, stolen or missing firearms eventually come to the attention of the police. 
A system of registration can assist the police in returning these firearms to the rightful owners. 
Registration can assist in the private property return to legitimate owners who have been the victims of crime. 
Since licensed users will have shown not to have been involved in criminal activity and to be otherwise responsible, and since guns will be registered the police will have an invaluable tool to assist them in their fight against crime.  
Opponents of the legislation contend that criminals will not register guns. 
We agree with that. 
The legislation through the licensing and registration provisions, however, will assist the police by providing them with additional tools to charge criminals and to address organized crime issues.  
The registration system will provide police with an invaluable tool to trace firearms among former owners. 
The tracing of these firearms is an invaluable tool for the investigation of crime. 
It helps to identify traffickers in illegal firearms. 
It helps to identify illegitimate businesses and it provides through ballistic evidence a means to identify guns involved in previously unsolved crimes.  
Registration increases the likelihood that criminal offenders will be charged and convicted for their crime. 
What parliamentarian would disagree with that?  
It will come as no surprise that the illegal movement of firearms into Canada is a problem of considerable magnitude. 
The registration system will register guns coming into and leaving Canada and the movement of those guns within the country. 
Illegal shipments will be easier to stop. 
Customs officers will be able to identify shipments against the registration database. 
Any firearm imported into Canada for sale will be traceable through its history in Canada.  
The reduction of firearms smuggling is an important way in which the Firearms Act and registration system can contribute to the reduction of crime.  
The Firearms Act is all about the regulation of potentially lethal commodities while at the same time permitting legitimate use by responsible owners. 
The registration system created by the Firearms Act is an important part of Canada's effort to establish that our way of life and our values are the values of a peaceful and safe nation.  
The opposition contends that the Firearms Act confiscates private property. 
We have said time and time again this legislation is about regulation, not confiscation.  
The outcome of this case will simply determine whether the constitutional powers of the Canadian government have been properly exercised in respect to this act. 
We will argue, as a matter of law, that it is in the order of peace, order and good government which are clear areas of federal jurisdiction. 
We hope that is the case and it most likely will be.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice said that she had every confidence that firearms owners will participate in the program.  
I spent a lot of time in my riding during the month of August. 
I held seven town hall and coffee shop meetings. 
From everybody I talked to I heard overwhelmingly that they are not going to participate in the program.  
The legal requirement to register one's firearms extends until 2003. 
The fact is there will be a federal election in the interim and the Reform Party, on forming the government in the next election, will repeal Bill C-68 immediately. 
It is important for all Canadians to know and understand that so they can exercise their decision on voting day in the next election with wisdom.  
The other thing I would like to point out is the rhetoric we hear from the Liberals on the other side of the House. 
It is all couched in these little fancy terms they have. 
They all talked about gun control and crime control. 
However, what this bill will really do is nothing when it comes to addressing these things.  
The Liberals' motive behind this legislation is their desire to see the elimination of all legal firearms ownership in Canada realized. 
That is something which is very important for all Canadians to know.  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. 
In making the statements he did, I think the member really showed the true colours of the Reform Party which is that it panders the special interests and for crass political reasons. 
We are doing the right thing for the benefits not only of this great country of ours but for each and every Canadian who lives in it.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, since the minister did not answer my second question, I would like to put the same question to the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington and ask him what this $350 million tab he referred to is all about, as this seems to be how much it would cost to implement this firearm registration system. 
Is that right? 
I would really like to get an answer on this today. 
If this amount is accurate, then the public must be made aware of the costs involved. 
And how did they get to be so high?  
I would also like to know whether this high tab would eventually make the system impossible to implement and result in Quebeckers being told ``Sorry, but unfortunately the system was too expensive to be implemented.'' 
Is this a roundabout way to avoid enforcing the legislation?  
Mr. Lynn Myers:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
I know there will be a price to pay for that but it is an important underpinning of the very values and institutions that define us as Canadians and in my view unite us as a nation.  
We are unlike opponents who would have us revert to some sort of American style in terms of shooting it out at high noon and all kinds of other outrageous and outlandish things, especially the Reform Party which should know better than to cosy up to those National Rifle Association types and others. 
Those members above all should know better but they do not.  
The point is we on the government side know we must proceed in a manner that is in keeping with our historic and political culture and our historic and political values. 
I am proud that we are able as a government to do precisely that.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the constituents of Souris-Moose Mountain, very similar to those of Cypress Hills-Grasslands, would find it almost sinful if their member did not speak on this issue.  
But I have received hundreds of letters and hundreds of petitions in opposition.  
I resent very much government members, including the Minister of Justice, speaking on this bill and referring to those who oppose this bill as somewhat misaligned in thought. 
There are thousands of people outside who have come from across Canada, some here from Yukon, who have paid out of their own pockets to protest and they are not weak in the head. 
They know exactly why they are here.  
I wish hon. members opposite would quit using statistics like 82% of this or 80% of that. 
How come this terrible misinformation wrongly or rightly got into the justice committee which completely distorted the number of guns involved? 
There is no remorse at all, none whatsoever from the government.  
But the word national would only affect western Canada. 
So they weighed it up and introduced the national energy policy and to this day western Canada has never forgiven the party for doing just that.  
Let me give the history behind Bill C-68. 
Let us get the true history behind Bill C-68. 
The former Conservative government had everything in place with the previous bill but crime was on the rage in Montreal and Toronto and so the government said once again it will do like the Liberals in the past, it will take a chance and bring in a national bill even though it knew it would isolate western Canada and certain parts. 
It did just that and it certainly paid off politically.  
One of the reasons why this government lost most of its western support was its complete disdain for western Canada. 
There is no remorse yet with the Liberals for the national energy policy and there is still no remorse for what they are doing to the law abiding people in western Canada with this bill. 
Where do they get the idea that the registration of guns will protect me?  
An hon. member:
Read the legislation.  
Mr. Roy Bailey:
The legislation says that there will be a registration of all guns. 
They cannot prove what they are saying and they know it.  
Yesterday afternoon in question period the former parliamentary secretary to the minister in charge of the wheat board asked a ridiculous question about North Dakota farmers wanting to sell wheat to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They make fun of people in different areas and they delight in doing so.  
The bill is not one law for all people. 
It is not a universal bill. 
The minister has declared that the bill will be flexible in its application. 
That in itself is a very dangerous statement.  
What do they mean that it will be flexible in its application? 
We know what it means. 
The people in western Canada know what it means, but the rest of Canada does not seem to know what it means. 
It means that some people will be required to register their long guns and some people will not. 
Yet the government supports the bill and says it will be flexible in its application.  
They want no part of it whatsoever. 
They have made it abundantly clear that they want nothing to do with it because they know certain people within their district will be exempt from registering their guns. 
It is not a national registration.  
Shame on the government. 
It deliberately harasses honest law-abiding citizens to register their guns but at its discretion it leaves whole blocks of people who do not have to register their guns.  
The legislation says that it is enabling legislation. 
That means the government, not the legislature, not this body, not elected officials, will have the right to change the bill at any time.  
The government is asking us to support the bill. 
The Minister of Justice says that it is a done deal, that the legislation will go forward, that it will be law for all but will be flexible. 
In other words it is not law for all and it can be changed at any time. 
All it has to do is sit before the committee.  
How can any person elected to the House who is totally in favour of the gun bill be in favour of making it selective legislation where only certain people will be required to register? 
How will that prevent crime? 
It just does not add up. 
The people in western Canada and the people in my constituency know this.  
I asked in the justice committee if they could guarantee that every owner of every long gun would have to register their guns? 
Do members know what the response was?  
An hon. member:
No answer.  
Mr. Roy Bailey:
There was no answer. 
How could the government in committee change legislation that we have been discussing without it even coming to the House? 
It is called enabling legislation.  
In closing I want to make clear that they can talk all they like about figures, fancy surveys and so on, but there is more opposition from every corner of Canada to Bill C-68 than there has ever been. 
Opposition from people who are aware of the bill is growing, even from those who do not own guns.  
They do not have the courage to make it universal. 
They do not have the courage to bring it back if they want to change the legislation. 
Having said that, they should not have had the courage to bring the bill before the House.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, never in my entire life have I heard so much nonsense coming from the opposition party. 
It is incredible.  
When the legislation was introduced by the House that party indicated it opposed the bill but did not put anything on the table to say how to improve it or the things they would like to see in the bill. 
The bill has gone through all stages. 
That party had all the time- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order, please. 
I think the Chair is hearing words that should not be uttered in the Chamber. 
I know hon. members would want to refrain from any unparliamentary language in the course of the debate even if it is from their seats. 
I hope I did not hear what I thought I heard.  
Mr. Mac Harb:
Mr. Speaker, I am sure you heard what you heard. 
Frankly it is unbecoming of the official opposition but it is an indication of the fact that it is bankrupt when it comes to ideas and innovations.  
It is shameful for them to be so opportunistic as to exploit public sentiment and to time, even though the bill has passed the House, their motion to coincide with a special interest group yapping outside on Parliament Hill without the true understanding of what the government is trying to do when it comes to public safety. 
The government has spent a lot of time and energy travelling around the country from coast to coast consulting the people, including special interest groups, the Reform Party, and every individual organization that had an opinion to express to the government. 
The government has given them that opportunity.  
It has been passed.  
I wish colleagues in the Reform Party would wake up, smell the coffee and come up with something that is relevant to the people of Canada, such as how the government has dealt with the economic situation, community safety, health care and educational issues. 
The government is handling these issues extremely well, so the Reform Party is trying to dig up issues that were before the House months ago and are not before the House now. 
The only reason for this is that some special interest groups are out there.  
The Reform Party is trying to exploit the sentiments of Canadians without having any consideration for the victims and their families who wanted to see that party stand and be counted rather than continue to hear this and that without really focusing on the overall interest of Canadians who have told us over and over again that they support what the government has put before them when it comes to the crime control bill. 
Let the member stand to endorse what the government has done on this issue.  
Mr. Roy Bailey:
Mr. Speaker, how dare the hon. member refer to the rural people of Souris-Moose Mountain as a special interest group. 
Shame on him. 
How dare he refer to the police associations out there in protest as special interest groups. 
How dare he refer to the Reform Party applying accountability for the position it holds by taking the bill back to the people and getting their opinion on it. 
How dare he make mockery of democracy.  
I guess my speech has intrinsically raised some guilt in the hon. person. 
My people are not special interest people. 
They are real people. 
They are not ignorant people. 
They are very clever people. 
The group out there has every right to protest. 
He would like to say that they are a special interest group, without intelligence, and they have no right. 
Shame on him.  
How could the member say that Reform sat idly by and did nothing when it brought in not a 150 amendments but 200 amendments to the bill. 
Shame on you for making that statement. 
You certainly are totally out- 
The Deputy Speaker:
I know the hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain intended to address his remarks through the Chair.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
These people are opposed to the registration of hunting weapons but, more importantly, they are opposed to searches without warrant and to the confiscation of private property without compensation. 
They fully understand the risk involved in giving the government the power to send police officers to our homes for the most trivial reasons, and they are getting worried.  
Unfortunately, these people are not represented by any Quebec member. 
For example, three years ago, a coalition of seven Quebec groups representing several hundreds of thousands of people opposed to Bill C-68 sought the support of Liberal, Conservative and Bloc members, but was turned down. 
In the end, it was a Reform member who became the spokesperson for these Quebeckers before the Standing Committee on Justice, in Ottawa.  
Bill C-68 is based on unfounded biases, on the fallacious arguments of some bureaucrats, and on mass hysteria. 
This is a pretty weak basis for an act.  
It is a sad fact that only a small minority of Canadians have an inkling of what Bill C-68 contains. 
This is not surprising when one considers its length of 137 pages and its complexity.  
The government's reluctance to release copies for public distribution is also a factor. 
I have had to have my own copies printed for interested constituents. 
The justice department's reluctance to let the public see this awful document is supposed to be an economy measure but there is no lack of funding for distribution of departmental propaganda or puff pieces for the Canadian firearms centre. 
My constituency office is full of that stuff.  
The provisions for arbitrary infringements or abrogations of civil rights and liberties which date back to 1689 have nothing to do with crime control and everything to do with the regulation of property which is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
Four provinces, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and two territories have tested the legitimacy of Bill C-68 in court and are still waiting after a whole year for a decision.  
Oddly enough, Quebec, the champion of provincial rights, remains on the sideline. 
The PQ government refuses to defend Quebec's right to conduct its own business. 
This is strange. 
Perhaps the members sitting to my left could explain this situation.  
In case anyone here has forgotten what the House passed in June 1995 and for the benefit of new Liberal backbenchers who probably have not read the bill, I wish to draw attention to some of the most noxious bits. 
I hope that new members will note the section numbers so that they can look it up themselves in case they do not believe me.  
Section 102. 
Police will be able to search premises without warrants on the flimsiest pretext. 
They will be empowered to open any container, require any person to produce records, enter any computer system and confiscate firearms or any other thing. 
These things can be done without any evidence that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. 
Oh Canada.  
Section 103. 
A custodian of premises being searched must co-operate with the inspectors or risk being charged under section 111 with an indictable offence carrying a penalty of up to two years in prison. 
In other words self-incrimination is now a requirement under Canadian law.  
Section 104. 
Section 117 provides the Minister of Justice with almost unlimited power to regulate firearms by order in council. 
Under section 108 those orders in council will become law within 30 days of being laid before parliament regardless of whether or not they are approved by parliament or even debated. 
Under section 119 even that slight bow to parliamentary democracy may be avoided if in the opinion of the minister these are immaterial, insubstantial or urgent.  
A few years ago the former justice minister described his dream of a Canada where only police and the military would possess arms. 
During debates in the House he altered his position perhaps because it dawned on him that he had succinctly described a police state.  
Now, thanks to events at last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, we know that the government has extended those police and military privileges to armed foreign thugs on Canadian soil. 
Was this indicative of philosophical kinship, a shared contempt for those damn peasants who do not know their place, who are not capable of making decisions and who do not share the prime ministerial vision of Canada?  
I have several times quoted James Madison in the House with regard to the loss of freedom. 
I shall close by doing it one more time. 
``There are more instances of the abridgements of freedom of people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.'' 
Words to live by.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I guess I should start by congratulating the gentleman across. 
I am quite surprised to hear that he is the self-appointed voice of Quebec now. 
That was quite amusing. 
I have a couple of questions for the hon. member.  
First of all, for my interest, I am wondering if he might clarify what he considers a special interest group. 
I have heard some of the hon. members say you cannot classify this as a special interest group, people in my riding. 
I am curious if he brought the entire population of his riding or a group of citizens within his riding that are interested in one specific topic, gun registration. 
I would ask what his definition of special interest group is because he certainly seems to be catering to them in this House.  
My second question is one on domestic violence and the fact of gun registration and is it appropriate. 
Domestic violence knows no borders. 
It happens in rural Canada. 
It happens in rural Alberta. 
It happens in rural Simcoe-Grey. 
And it certainly takes place in many urban communities throughout this country.  
Mr. Lee Morrison:
Mr. Speaker, I will start at the top. 
The hon. member asked so many questions that I have already forgotten the first couple.  
This question of knowing whether or not there are firearms in the house is ridiculous. 
I have discussed this with a lot of frontline police officers. 
I dare say the hon. member has not.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick:
Once again speaking on my behalf.  
Mr. Lee Morrison:
You bet.  
The object of this supposedly is to make it safe for police. 
Any police officer who is not demented is going to approach a house with domestic violence in progress as though there were arms in that house. 
If he does not, he will probably end up dead at some point. 
They do not need and they will not rely upon a computer record to tell them they should be careful, that there are arms there.  
The police officers treat every domestic incident as a potentially violent situation. 
So this is just nonsense that is being discussed here.  
With respect to special interest groups, there is a very clear definition of special interest groups. 
Special interest groups are these bloodsucking institutions that get federal funding. 
I have not heard of those people out front, those ordinary real Canadians whose freedoms are being endangered by these cryptofascists, who are being abused, who are being threatened, tell me that they are getting federal funding. 
If they are getting federal funding, I would like to see the cancelled cheques.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member, a colleague of mine in the Reform Party, if he sees any parallels between this depriving of civil liberties and freedom of speech in this obnoxious gun control bill and the APEC summit and some of the depriving of rights that took place there on that occasion.  
Mr. Lee Morrison:
Mr. Speaker, there is a very definite parallel. 
I think there is also a parallel between this and the snipers I see standing on the roof of the Langevin building today to defend themselves against a bunch of Canadian farmers. 
If the member does not think they are there, he should go out and take a look.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I think it shows much progress and I congratulate him.  
According to an Angus Reid poll done in May 1995, 79% of Quebeckers supported Bill C-68. 
Quebec's own Minister of Justice at the time, Paul Bégin, officially backed the bill. 
A few months earlier, in November 1994, a Gallup poll had revealed that nine out of ten Quebeckers, or 90% of Quebec's population, were in favour of registering all firearms.  
This has been a fact of life in Quebec since 1972, because provincial legislation requires that all firearms be registered anyway.  
Bill C-68 is a bill of which we on the government side are very proud. 
Today, the bill is law in Canada. 
To reopen this debate, as the Reform Party wants to do today, in league with the National Firearms Association, brings to mind what is going on in the United States.  
The right wing and the extreme right wing have been sleeping with the National Rifle Association for ever and a day. 
No matter what the congress of the United States wants to do to express the desire of what has been seen in poll after poll, the majority view of the great number of Americans that want some control over firearms, the right wing has managed in the United States to defeat it because of the tremendous lobbying power of the National Rifle Association.  
Thank the Lord here we will not be cowed if it is 2,000, 5,000 or 20,000. 
We have been elected by a majority of Canadians to express their views. 
Their views on gun control legislation have been extremely clear. 
In fact the police chiefs across the land have pointed out as shown in a study published by the Ottawa Citizen on August 28, 1997 that 52% of guns found at crime scenes in Canada are shotguns or rifles.  
I know registration is not very pleasant. 
We have to register our boats. 
I register my boat every year. 
It is something I would like to avoid if I could but I do it. 
If they made a law tomorrow to make licensing of people handling motorboats compulsory, I would be for it. 
It would be an inconvenience but if it can save people from getting hurt or from being killed then it is certainly a step forward despite the inconvenience. 
I register my car every year and it is not pleasant. 
I have to send a cheque to get the sticker. 
We all do. 
The difference between cars, boats and guns is that guns maim and kill. 
The experience in Canada is that guns kill a lot of people, as they do everywhere in the world.  
If registration can save 100 lives, only 100 lives, if it can save 20 lives, if it can save just one life, then it is justified.  
I cannot believe what I hear. 
But it is never the cost of a life lost. 
We should not be quarrelling about the price, whether it is $50 million, $60 million or $100 million.  
I sincerely thank the member for Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, who focussed on the broad issue of registering firearms, looking at all the ridiculous arguments that have been raised by opponents of Bill C-68. 
They said it will cost a fortune, and so forth, when registration will, in fact, be a one-time event, costing only a few dollars annually, just like a driving licence, just like licensing our car or boat costs a few dollars.  
What harm is there in that, if registering firearms makes it possible for police forces to identify them more accurately and if it discourages us from using them?  
The Reform Party speaks as if we live in a cocoon. 
I heard them talking about the west against the rest of Canada. 
Yet there was a poll taken in the riding of the member for Edmonton North which said that 55% favoured registration and 28% were against.  
They seem to imply that we are alone in the world. 
I would like to mention a few figures to them. 
Licensing is required in Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Japan, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain- 
Mr. Dick Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the hon. member's comments he is referring to poll numbers. 
In order that we might be better informed, could he perhaps tell us clearly what the poll question was?  
The Deputy Speaker:
With respect, I think the hon. member is asking a question and not raising a point of order. 
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
It is typical of them.  
The registration of firearms is required in five of eight states of Australia, in Belgium, Finland, France-except for selected sporting rifles-in Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.  
Of course all these people do not know any better, but they do ask for registration of firearms. 
They care for their sporting guns. 
They care for shooting. 
They care for hunting, but they do not mind registering their guns. 
They do not mind being licensed for holding guns because they believe it is better for the common safety of their population.  
Compare this to the United States where a free-for-all has existed for years. 
Shooting and crime are rampant, no matter how many jails they build. 
They have more jails and more people to execute, but there is still more crime. 
They will not register their guns because of the force of the NRA and the right wing.  
We do not want to be the same here. 
We do not want to fall into the same trap, to be on the side of the Reform Party and the National Firearms Association. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, just so we can bring some truth and honesty to this debate, the question that was asked on the Liberal poll was: ``Would you support gun control considering it would cut crime and save lives?'' 
What Canadian would not vote yes for a question like that?  
As this members knows, because he was here in the last parliament when the former minister of justice brought in the bill, day after day after the bill was introduced Reform Party members asked the minister and his cohorts to give us one historical piece of evidence, one substantive fact or one honest description of how Bill C-68 would cut crime in this country and we would vote for it. 
Not one Liberal on that side could tell us how Bill C-68 would cut crime and save lives in this country.  
Have things changed? 
Has the former minister of justice changed his mind about it? 
We cannot see any evidence and we are still asking that of the Liberal government. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
Mr. Speaker, this is so simplistic it is sad. 
I did not decide for myself how it was going to save lives. 
I am not smart enough to know that. 
It is not my field. 
These people are overwhelmingly in favour of gun control legislation.  
I am also relying on the example of other countries. 
I have cited a list of countries as long as my arm that insist on registration.  
Mr. Dick Harris:
Just answer the question.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
They ignore what the police chiefs, the magistrates, the judges and the great majority of Canadians are saying poll after poll after poll.  
Regardless of the polls, about 75% of Canadians do not want any of the Reform Party's notion that freedom means carrying guns that are not registered and not licensed. 
Canadians at large are saying loud and clear that they want guns to be registered and gun owners to be licensed. 
That is what we have expressed here as the representatives of the majority of Canadians who elected us.  
This is a democratic law, passed by a democratic government. 
If the Reform Party does not want to abide by it, too bad. 
Canadians will judge them accordingly.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis on his speech and I would like to ask him, following on the questions from my colleague from Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, whether according to his information, he can confirm the rumours about the costs of this new firearm registration program, forecast to be in the order of $80 million, now having risen to $350 million.  
First of all, is this rumour correct, and second, if it is, how can the hon. member, with the information at his disposal, explain such a cost increase, and what lies behind such an increase?  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln:
Mr. Speaker, there has been no decision on costs. 
All that is still being put into place. 
All we know is that costs have been set for permit charges, and for registration charges. 
We do not know the exact cost of processing and of the operation as a whole.  
As my Liberal colleague who spoke before me pointed out, however, the key element in all this is surely the cost of human life.  
That is the key element in all this is. 
How can we judge the cost of a human life that has been protected by firearm registration and licencing? 
That is where the underlying principle lies.  
As for the overall cost of implementing the system, I cannot give any exact figures.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one thing that I have noticed here today is that the opponents of this legislation seem to distort, misrepresent and deny the benefits of this legislation.  
When I look at and start to think about what this legislation is going to do for the average Canadian, I think it proposes safe streets, a confidence that someone can live in a community without a threat, and many, many things that we should discuss here today.  
I would like to look at the positive aspects of this legislation. 
The law imposes tough criminal penalties. 
They say ``Don't touch the criminal''. 
That is absolute nonsense.  
Even our opponents across the way have to admit that this legislation does a great deal to impose penalties on people who misuse guns in this community. 
The minimum penalty of four years, in many cases, is a very strong deterrent to those people who would misuse guns in the commission of a crime.  
The courts, by the way, have totally supported this legislation up to this day. 
The statute is about lethal instruments, articles designed for the most part to kill. 
It recognizes that the vast majority of firearm owners and users are responsible, prudent people. 
The practices which are embodied in the statutes reflect the prudent practices of responsible people.  
The statute strives to encourage a culture that is safe for Canadians, a culture that is well trained in activities and practices for responsible gun owners.  
The legitimate practices of those responsible gun owners can continue under this statute. 
Hunters can continue to hunt. 
Target shooters can continue to target shoot. 
Museums can continue to display the weapons that are displayed today.  
It is worth noting that there are 30 times more firearms in the United States than there are in Canada.  
Do members realize that? 
There are double the number of homicides in the United States than there are in Canada and those members are telling us to look at that country. 
That is nonsense.  
That means we cannot have children exposed to them. 
Recent news events describing schoolyard shootings speak for themselves. 
The Firearms Act addresses only crucial social situations that are created by domestic violence. 
Required firearms licensing and screening of gun owners will result in specific checking of probation orders, prohibition to orders before licences are granted. 
Licences will have to be renewed every five years. 
So there will be an examination of violence on a regular basis. 
For those who wish to acquire new firearms, the applicants must contact their former spouses or someone involved with them so that if there is a problem they will be able to bring that testimony forward.  
When fully implemented all firearms owners will be licensed. 
They will have taken a course emphasizing safety and safe handling of guns. 
The guns will be registered. 
This will assist police in their investigations. 
It will encourage owners of stores and guns to make sure sales are appropriate. 
It will assist the recovery of lost or stolen firearms.  
Registration together with licensing and other aspects of firearms is aimed at facilitating a continued enjoyment of sport in Canada by responsible safe practices. 
This will encourage the continuation of free movement of Canadian citizens within a culture that recognizes safety and responsibility. 
The Firearms Act embraces all these as positive effective contributors to all aspects of Canadian life. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, listening to the comments of the hon. member opposite is a revelation of a thought process I do not quite comprehend and do not pretend to understand. 
I thought I was a fairly clear, reasonably thinking person. 
There are a number of discrepancies in what the hon. member is saying. 
I would like to question him on a couple of them.  
I will use an example. 
This morning on the Internet I found some information put out by the government. 
It is propaganda on Bill C-68. 
One of the items is 10 reasons for the registration of all guns. 
We could go through the argument point by point but we would be wasting a lot of valuable time although they deserve to be looked at. 
One of the last points is less paperwork. 
I want to ask the hon. member about that issue. 
Somehow this is going to put more policeman in service on the streets because we will have less paperwork.  
These are the application forms for this law that is going to bring less paperwork, make our streets safer, give us more policemen actually on the beat in our communities. 
It starts with 669 and goes up to 774. 
These are the forms that are available for registering guns.  
There are applications for a possession only licence under the Firearms Act for individuals who currently own firearms; for a possession and acquisition licence under the Firearms Act for acquiring firearms and/or crossbows, these are for individuals; for a firearms licence under the Firearms Act; for a firearms licence for businesses and museums; for a sponsor of a gun show; for a carrier firearm licence; to register non-registered firearms, long guns for individuals; to register a newly imported restricted firearm for individuals; to reregister previously registered firearms, restricted and prohibited firearms; to register firearms for businesses and museums; for authorization to transport restricted and prohibited firearms and prohibited handguns; for authorization to carry restricted firearms and prohibited handguns; transfer and to register, and there is another full page of applications.  
I would like the hon. member to explain it.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard:
Mr. Speaker, I have to think you would agree with me how incredible it is that a member can stand for four minutes and describe all the different forms that we have after a speech on safety in the communities.  
When we start looking at a comparison between the United States and Canada on safety of our streets and we think about what the average Canadian wants and needs for safe communities, the only question he can come to is that we have 100 forms here and we may have to fill them out.  
To me it is incredible that is the mentality driving the debate. 
To me the critical issue is safety. 
It is lives. 
It is good community spirit. 
It is making sure that the use of those firearms by Canadians is still allowed. 
I would say that once all the guns are registered, once all the forms are filled, once we get that and it is recorded in today's society, we do have the means by which to reduce paperwork dramatically. 
Everyone knows paperwork can be reduced dramatically if it is organized and presented properly. 
That is exactly what those forms are doing. 
Once it is done, once it is in the registry, once we have all the paperwork done then the continuation is very reasonable and can be carried out in a good, appropriate way.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what we have come here today to discuss and debate is a matter of utmost importance. 
That goes without saying. 
I have heard comments in here in the last few minutes about whether this is supported, safety and these various issues that come up.  
With regard to support, I would like the members in the House, if they have not already done so, to take a few minutes and step outside and look at the Canadians standing out there, average Canadians. 
They are not people who are looking to break the law. 
These are average Canadians who have come here en masse with one of the biggest demonstrations certainly that has been seen here for a long time, if not ever.  
For every one of those people out there I can assure members that there are hundreds and possibly thousands represented by each one of those. 
I met the other day with the minister of justice in Manitoba, Mr. Vic Toews. 
If he does not represent one million Manitobans on this issue, I will eat my shirt.  
The fact is he will not be appointing inspectors under this legislation. 
He is saying that this legislation is bad, it is wrong, he does not support it, the province of Manitoba does not support it, the premier does not support it nor do the people of Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario, the Northwest Territories and the aboriginal people.  
How many more do the Reform Party have to identify as Canadians who are against the Firearms Act to convince the members opposite that they are out to lunch on their exaggerated numbers they claim support this bill? 
As referenced in the court case which happened in Edmonton, the justice department, on behalf of the Liberal government, took the RCMP statistics and built them up to a point where they were plain untrue. 
There was a lot of correction over that. 
They finally got the RCMP to admit that the figures had been misinterpreted or something. 
That is not true. 
They were outright changed.  
The question of safety is one that has been debated here for some time. 
I will go back to my experience in life as a police officer. 
The question of safety with firearms was already addressed fully before the Firearms Act came into place. 
There was safe storage. 
There were firearm training programs. 
I was an instructor at one time. 
There was registration of handguns. 
The registration was inaccurate but it was there. 
I never seized any registered guns from the criminals I arrested.  
With regard to safety in family disputes, you did not know whether there was going to be a firearm in the house or whether the fellow or wife was previously known to have firearms. 
The computer systems the RCMP and the Ontario provincial police had already had the capability of entering and tracking these people as dangerous. 
There were already provisions for serial numbers of stolen firearms to be entered. 
Residents and people who were known to be active criminals or who were known to be suspects capable of violence were entered. 
The computer systems were there.  
The idea that this is going to increase safety it wrong. 
I hesitate to use these words, but the hidden agenda of this government is clearly to make up enough rules that the average law abiding Canadian is going to break some of those rules either in transferring a firearm or registering it wrongly. 
The government can then take that act and say they have made a mistake. 
The ultimate goal would be to remove as many or all guns from legitimate law abiding Canadians. 
This government is proceeding along the road of arming more of its departments. 
The question I ask is will this hidden agenda ultimately end up with only the government and the criminals owning guns and the average Canadian having nothing. 
There are all kinds of these things happening. 
It all translates into more government control.  
Before this act came into effect the Criminal Code indicated that a criminal who used a weapon during the commission of a crime could be sentenced for that offence. 
The sentence could be harsher. 
These things were all in place. 
It is frustrating to know that the only impact of the act put in place by the government will be an increase in costs for average Canadians to own firearms. 
I will relate an experience I had the other day. 
I was attending a clay shoot which involves aiming at little clay targets with shotguns. 
There were about 60 to 70 people there from my riding. 
It was a beautiful sunny day. 
We had a nice time. 
I am sure we were not hurting anyone. 
I did not see any criminals. 
There were none. 
We are talking about support for this type of legislation. 
The talk that day was that the legislation would add costs for firearms and ammunition to a hobby that already had costs built into it.  
They will not be spending money which helps the economy. 
More than that, what is irking a lot of us is that we have the right to enjoy ourselves. 
If we are doing it in a lawful manner, why should the government put hindrances and expenses on us which are not needed and will do no good other than for its belief that Canadians should not own firearms and that only governments and foreign powers that come to the country with their security guards should be the ones to have firearms?  
I stand by my right as a Canadian to own a firearm without harassment from my government. 
I intend to fight for that. 
I support the motion entirely and I invite every member, particularly those on the Liberal side who know what their constituents want, to vote for the motion.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was quite amazed to listen to the member's comments. 
I was wondering if some of the people in the House and some of the people watching today were actually listened to what he is doing.  
The hon. member is fearmongering. 
He is suggesting that the Liberal government is trying to create a police state. 
Perhaps the hon. member should visit a police state. 
He should be absolute ashamed of himself. 
Enough of the fearmongering and enough of the false statistics. 
He should simply makes some calculated comments without- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I know the hon. member by his comment has provoked something in the House, but it is very hard for the Chair to hear and I do need to hear what hon. members on all sides are saying. 
I would appreciate some order.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick:
Mr. Speaker, thank you for quieting them down. 
They get to be quite a violent lot some times. 
My point was simply to suggest that the Liberal government is trying to create a police state is absolutely false.  
The hon. member mentioned that he was a past police officer and did not see any benefit in the legislation. 
Let me give him an example. 
What would he think if he were attending a domestic violence call in a municipality of 15,000 people where he did not know everybody? 
I am sure the hon. member accepts the fact that domestic violence knows no bounds, not just urban but rural. 
I ask that question.  
Should he take the person's word that there is only one or two guns, or should he not have access to knowing? 
Is it not fair to say that police officers should have access to knowing there are long arms in there? 
Perhaps, if the member would take off his blinders, he could help officers to eliminate some domestic violence situations that turn into tragedies.  
Would it be useful information to an officer responding to a call if he were provided in advance with the fact that there were long arms in there which could potentially be used in a domestic violence situation?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom:
Mr. Speaker, no. 
In that area the hon. member is listening simply to chiefs of police.  
He spoke also of fearmongering. 
Let us talk about fearmongering. 
He can take a look at the city police in Winnipeg and at the courts. 
In the newspapers the other day there was an article about a gang rape of a 15 year old girl by four bikers. 
This young girl refused to testify in court. 
She was terrified of the criminal and refused to testify, and the police could not protect her.  
Fearmongering is on the side of those who promote gun registration. 
The moneys being spent on firearm registration should be spent on working with victims of crimes and fighting the biker gangs. 
There is nothing being spent on biker gangs, and $150 million would help. 
The Deputy Speaker:
Resuming debate with the hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Some hon. members:
Hear, hear.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Order please. 
I know there is a lot of enthusiasm for the hon. member for Wild Rose, but I also know that hon. members would want to hear his remarks. 
I would hope that there would be some quiet.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Let me make an exception. 
The gun registration under Bill C-68 is to cost $200 million. 
Let us say that is the case. 
We have not been told once how it will save a life. 
We asked the Liberals, lots of times, to please show us how it would save a life.  
Let me make a second exception. 
Probably two of the biggest killers we have in the country are breast cancer and prostate cancer. 
If we had $200 million and it had to go to one or the other, how many Liberals would pick gun registration over cancer research? 
I will tell the House how many would pick gun registration: all of them because they listen to the dictators and they do what they are told to do.  
This legislation has in it nearly a hundred times where one person in the House, one individual on that frontline can decide whether or not a certain firearm should be confiscated.  
That is the power that exists under the bill. 
That is the kind of power to which any normal Canadian taxpayer objects. 
That is the kind of power they have in all these countries that have failed a hundred times under dictatorial power. 
When will members on that side of the House wake up and smell the coffee? 
I heard a member over there a while ago saying ``smell the coffee''.  
Members on that side of the House are a bunch of sheep. 
They do what they are told because they believe strongly in the will of the party and not the will of the people. 
That is what they believe in.  
Let me give an example. 
In a week or two they will be reading an article in the Western Producer written by Larry Fillo describing the absurdity of the bill. 
On July 10, 1998, Lorraine Dewetter was informed by two police officers of the death of her husband. 
Mr. Dewetter apparently died after a heart attack when his vehicle was stuck in a field. 
The RCMP, however, did more than just deliver the unfortunate news of Mr. Dewetter's passing. 
While in the Dewetter home informing his wife of his death the RCMP confiscated a .22 calibre rifle and a 12-guage pump action shotgun.  
That is what comes about with this kind of legislation: search and seizure without any particular reason. 
It contains unreasonable search and seizure regulations. 
It is unreasonable to do that. 
It confiscates property. 
It did in this case. 
Members can read about it in the Western Producer in two weeks.  
The Speaker:
After question period the hon. member for Wild Rose has the floor. 
He still has approximately five minutes left. 
Right now we are going to Statements by Members and will begin with the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
THE LATE DAVE NICHOLSON 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Constable Dave Nicholson, a 32 year old member of the Waterloo Regional Police Service who lived in Heidelberg, Ontario, recently drowned while trying to retrieve the body of a 12 year old Cambridge boy, Mark Gage.  
Constable Nicholson's funeral was held in Kitchener on August 19, 1998. Thousands of police, peace officers and firefighters joined family and friends at the solemn occasion.  
Constable Dave Nicholson was an outstanding police officer, a devout family man, a loving father, a wonderful husband and an exceptional citizen of our great Canada. 
He will be sadly missed by all who knew him, who worked with him and who had contact with him.  
The death of Constable Nicholson underscores the courage and bravery of those whose job it is to protect Canadians wherever they may be.  
I ask the House to join with me in remembering Constable Dave Nicholson. 
He was a man of great faith and conviction. 
He will be greatly missed. 
He is now in the hands of God.  
* * * 
HOUSING 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it seems that my parliamentary colleague and my constituency neighbour from Port Moody-Coquitlam was hit in the head by a golf ball when he shared the links with the Prime Minister this summer.  
If he has resolved the buck passing of this government for the water damage disaster, why are so many constituents protesting with picket signs when he speaks at local events? 
These concerned British Columbians are pleading for relief, the same relief which I have repeatedly asked of this government through letters, speeches and Order Paper questions.  
* * * 
1998 ONTARIO SUMMER GAMES 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
I must say that Guelph-Wellington did shine.  
The theme for the games was ``Reach for your dreams'' and Ontario's best young athletes did just that. 
With the support of their fellow competitors, families and hundreds of spectators, these athletes broke records, set personal bests and created memories that will last a lifetime.  
I would like to congratulate the city of Guelph, the organizers of the games, general manager Tim Mau, and especially the nearly 1,800 volunteers who came from all over our great community.  
This wonderful spirit of volunteerism and community involvement is part of what makes Guelph-Wellington the best place to live in Canada.  
* * * 
HEPATITIS C 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the government is totally insensitive to the expectations of Canadians who are demanding fair compensation for all victims of contaminated blood.  
Despite this majority request, the government is setting up a system of compensation by category. 
Some victims will receive financial compensation and specific medical services, others will receive only medical services. 
This is unfair and unacceptable. 
As one of my constituents, Jean-Daniel Couture, put it, the government's position in this matter is absolutely disgusting.  
We in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada do not intend to give in to this irresponsible attitude. 
We will continue to fight in the House to ensure that all victims of hepatitis C are fully and fairly compensated.  
* * * 
CANADIAN COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Canadian Council for International Co-operation for undertaking an in common mission to Indonesia and Thailand with members of parliament, the native community, the civil society and non-governmental organizations.  
As part of the in common campaign for a poverty-free world, the purpose of the mission was to investigate the roots of the Asian financial crisis, the effects of the crisis on the poor and its implications for Canada.  
The delegation found that the human and development crises are immense and require an urgent response from Canada and the international community.  
I call on my colleagues to join the in common campaign and take action to build greater awareness for the elimination of global poverty. 
I applaud the CCIC for bringing this important issue to the attention of both the Canadian public and government. Keep up the good work, CCIC.  
* * * 
GUN REGISTRATION 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday I met with a delegation of concerned gun owners who have travelled from my riding of Prince Albert to take part in today's Fed Up rally against Bill C-68.  
In response to pressure from people like these and with less than 10 days remaining, the minister finally caved in to common sense and postponed the implementation date until December 1.  
Now if the government, which has had three years to hear objections to this legislation, remains committed to it, here is what millions of law-abiding Canadians can expect: criminal charges for failure to comply; seizure of private property without compensation; padlocks on the doors of legitimate businesses.  
Clearly this piece of legislation is unworkable.  
We call on the minister now to commit to withholding implementation until the courts can rule on the legality of Bill C-68.  
* * * 
BIG BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF CANADA 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the month of September is Big Brothers and Sisters month. 
Big Brothers and Sisters of Canada focuses on mentoring activity by matching a man with the right boy, or a woman with the right girl.  
Research shows that having a big brother or sister makes a positive difference to many boys and girls. 
Just think about it. 
Young adolescents saying no to drugs and alcohol, improving their school attendance and getting along better with their families and peers. 
All because they had big brothers and big sisters.  
This is not a dream. 
It is a reality. 
This is good news particularly at a time when about 23% of all families are led by a single parent and when many people contend that nothing works in reaching teenagers.  
You can reach Big Brothers and Sisters of Canada at 1-800-263-9133.  
* * * 
GUN CONTROL 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on September 1 the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville told Alberta radio listeners that Canada should look to the U.S. for leadership on guns.  
I cannot believe that the Reform Party would want Canada to follow the American gun culture. 
Every day in the U.S. there are firearm tragedies happening in many homes. 
How many children will have to die before the Reform Party realizes that the U.S. is not an example Canadians want to follow? 
How long will it take them to realize that these are not Canadian values?  
* * * 
SECURITY SYSTEM 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here are the top ten reasons why the Prime Minister thinks it is a good idea to spend 80,000 taxpayer dollars on a security system for his summer cottage.  
Number ten, it only represents the total taxes paid by four Canadian families for an entire year.  
Number nine, it is essential since eventually even the Prime Minister runs out of pepper spray.  
Number eight, there are not enough registered Inuit carvings to protect himself.  
Number seven, his homeless friend is okay with it.  
Number six, it was already budgeted in the price of the Shawinigan canoe museum.  
Number five, it costs no more than another unelected senator.  
Number four, unlike the senator at least it does not go to Mexico in the wintertime.  
Number three, hep C victims will understand his priority spending.  
Number two, it is a national unity thing, everyone in Canada thinks it is a stupid idea.  
* * * 
GUN CONTROL 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the gun lobby assembled on Parliament Hill today will hear from an American, John Lott, who professes that if more people had guns, there would be less crime.  
After the tragic and senseless school shootings in Arkansas, Lott wrote that fewer people would have been killed or injured if the teachers had been armed. 
The same John Lott told an Alberta radio audience that the homicide rate for white Americans is comparable to that for white Canadians.

COMMONWEALTH GAMES 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to congratulate Canada's 275 athletes, and more particularly the 35 athletes from Quebec, who participated in the 16th Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur from September 11 to 21.  
Their performances put Canada in third place among the 68 delegations. 
He was right. 
His gold medal in the ten metre diving competition makes him the youngest Canadian gold medal winner in the Commonwealth Games, and likely the youngest medal winner in the history of the games.  
Well done, Alexandre, and best of luck on your next mission, the 2000 Olympic Games.

SOUTHEAST ASIA 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I recently returned from Indonesia and Thailand on a mission led by the Canadian Council for International Co-operation to see the impact of the Asian financial crisis on the people who live there.  
The impact is catastrophic. 
Families are desperate, reeling from massive unemployment and skyrocketing food prices. 
And for many, the last threads of hope are rapidly unwinding.  
Upon our return we called on the government to fundamentally change its role in global economic management. 
The World Bank and IMF's prescription is disastrous. 
These institutions must be completely overhauled to ensure that the forces of globalization create equity and serve the needs of people.  
Instead of using pepper spray to stifle students protesting APEC in Vancouver, instead of ignoring the cries of hunger from citizens around the world who are paying the consequences of global capital gone berserk, this government must end its complicity with the financial power brokers and champion global reform to alleviate poverty and environmental degradation.

GUN CONTROL 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
I wish to state that, with firearm control legislation, the government is responding to the call of Canadians, the parents of child victims of crimes or accidents involving firearms in particular.  
We are going to continue to work along with these Canadians, who have called for gun control legislation in hopes of reducing the crime rate in our communities.  
The government will not allow itself to be intimidated by statements from the other side of the floor, or from demonstrators on the Hill. 
A large majority of Canadians support gun control. 
The debate is closed. 
The Canadian firearms control program will come into effect December 1.  
* * * 
SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, on September 2, 1999 the citizens of Canada will pause and remember the tragic crash of Swissair flight 111. 
Many citizens of the south shore of Nova Scotia are living today with the aftermath of that disaster. 
The communities on the Aspotogen Peninsula and Tancook Island are in the midst of the ongoing cleanup effort that is literally on their doorsteps.  
Fishers from those communities were among the first to respond. 
They, like their forebears, are no strangers to disasters at sea. 
They left their homes in the dark of night to assist in the desperate search for survivors. 
Today there are still hundreds of men and women involved in the cleanup.  
The sincere effort made by all the volunteers and professionals who have assisted and continue to assist in this tragic accident is a testimony to the strength of Canadian character and the true fibre of the men and women of the south shore of Nova Scotia. 
* * * 
FIREARMS 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as the gun lobby gathers on Parliament Hill, I would like to remind this House that the purpose of our government's Firearms Act is to help ensure Canadians continue to live in a safe society. 
When I look at our neighbours to the south, I am shocked to see the gun lobby fight simple protective measures like trigger locks and safe firearms storage.  
I am horrified every time I hear about a child taking firearms to school and using them with deadly consequences on innocent schoolmates.  
The Reform Party and other opponents of Canada's new Firearms Act would have us believe that firearms regulation is just one step on a slippery slope. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
I want to assure law-abiding gun owners that they have nothing to fear from the Minister of Justice or this government. 
Our commitment is to make sure that gun control is implemented in the most efficient way possible.

PRIME MINISTER 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):
Yesterday, the Prime Minister described the Mike Harris government as ``ultra-right''. 
Rather than labelling other people, the Prime Minister should be looking at his own record.  
Over his long career in politics, he was involved in the War Measures Act. 
He was the hatchet man in the 1982 constitutional coup d'état. 
He was one of the key figures in the destruction of the Meech Lake Accord. 
He was involved in organizing the repression of a peaceful demonstration by students at Vancouver. 
He has cut $42 million from social programs. 
He has dipped into the employment insurance fund surplus to the tune of $20 billion, using it clandestinely to pay back part of the debt.  
Worse still, the Prime Minister is the one who rejected outright the unanimous agreement by the provincial premiers to put money back into health care.  
With a record like this, how can the Prime Minister still claim to be a Liberal?  
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
APEC SUMMIT 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why will the Prime Minister not simply apologize to the Canadian students who were wrongfully pepper sprayed at the APEC summit conference?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that some people had a problem with the police there. 
No one wished for that to happen and that is why there is an inquiry.  
Where there are situations like that, when people feel that they have not been treated fairly, there is a process to help them. 
It allows them to see whether the police acted in an unethical or illegal fashion. 
There is an inquiry into this.  
At the end we will see who is responsible and who is not. 
That is why there is an inquiry. 
If some people were not well treated, certainly- 
The Speaker:
The Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is playing dumb on this question. 
Our complaint is not with the RCMP but with the Prime Minister who gave them their orders.  
Our concerns cannot be resolved by the commission. 
They can only be resolved by the Prime Minister himself coming clean on this issue.  
Will the Prime Minister explain to this House and to the students his role, not the RCMP's role, in this fiasco?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my role was very simple. 
I was the host of 19 leaders who came to Canada. 
The RCMP was responsible for keeping order so that the leaders visiting Canada could be safe. 
This is done for every meeting of this nature.  
My role was to be chairman of the APEC meeting on behalf of Canada at that time. 
The people of Vancouver received the leaders very well.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is very interesting because that is not what the RCMP say. 
They say they were instructed to suppress peaceful protesters even if they were not a security risk.  
RCMP memos say things like ``PM's specific wish'' or ``PM wants the protesters out''. 
That PM was not me and it was not the Minister of Finance. 
Who was it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I know at least one of the two will not become the PM.  
I have been in politics for a long time. 
As a minister, I have seen many people in departments speaking on behalf of their ministers or on behalf of the prime minister, not knowing- 
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
The Speaker:
Colleagues, I know we all want to hear the questions and the answers. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this Prime Minister seems to have his fingerprints all over this. 
The ``PM'' he is talking about is a post-mortem that Canadians want on this whole issue because they are disgusted.  
Why is it that the Prime Minister resorts to blaming a bureaucrat? 
Why does he not believe in ministerial accountability, stand up in his place right now and say ``I'm responsible. 
I apologize and I will explain what I did in this affair''?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is an inquiry that is being conducted in Vancouver on this incident, which occurred during the last hours of the APEC meeting, when the 19 leaders came to Canada and we were the hosts. 
The inquiry will look at all the facts.  
I said before, and I will repeat, that I hosted the meeting. 
Until the end everything went very well. 
After it was over they informed me that there was an incident at the last hour of the meeting.  
There is an inquiry into what happened there because- 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the Prime Minister was shocked there was an incident because he very clearly pointed out that he did not want to be embarrassed and have other leaders be embarrassed.  
This public commission looks into the activities of the RCMP, not the unethical activities of politicians.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member tends to exaggerate a bit. 
Just a bit. 
She is very consistent. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the further we delve into ``peppergate'', the more we realize that the real responsibility for suppressing anti-Suharto demonstrators lies not with the RCMP but with the Canadian government, which was consumed with reassuring the dictator.  
Yesterday, we learned that the RCMP liaison officer was told to do everything necessary to meet Suharto's demands.  
Will the Prime Minister admit that the testimony by officer Peter Montague confirms that the extreme intervention by the RCMP in Vancouver is directly related to the directives his government issued to the RCMP?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I said, there is an investigation into this matter. 
The commission is to begin its work shortly. 
Let us leave it to do its work.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the commission of inquiry will investigate the actions of the RCMP, as the Prime Minister points out. 
Our questions are directed not at the RCMP, but at the Prime Minister.  
Would the Prime Minister be so good as to tell us what lesson we are to learn from seeing a supposed statesman deliberately crushing the individual rights of his fellow citizens so that he can stay on good terms with a dictator, because that is the fact of the matter?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Such rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. 
I would like to inform the hon. member that, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs pointed out yesterday, we provided financial assistance to bring protestors to the parallel summit in Vancouver. 
We ourselves provided assistance for protestors to come from other countries to hold a parallel summit in Vancouver.  
For people who do not want to hear anything about civil liberties, I think we have gone further than anyone in issuing an invitation to these people and paying their expenses so that they could come and protest.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, for two days now the Prime Minister has been hiding behind the RCMP public complaints commission in order to avoid answering questions on the role he and his office played in repressing Vancouver students during the visit of dictator Suharto.  
How can the Prime Minister hide behind this commission when the issue is that he and his office dealt with the RCMP as if it were a political police force?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there will be an inquiry. 
Inquiry members will question those who come before them. 
As everyone knows, two senior officials from my office have agreed to go and testify.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing the same tape. 
The question is very simple: are we to understand that in future the behaviour of the RCMP at demonstrations will be determined by foreign visitors, including dictators?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the rules proposed were for the protection of all leaders of all the governments present, and they were all given the same treatment.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
A federal government lawyer claims that the Prime Minister has no relevant testimony to give before the Public Complaints Commission.  
Is the Prime Minister pretending that he never discussed the handling of protesters or the accommodating of Suharto's sensitivities with any of his officials?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was aware that some of the delegations wanted reassurance. 
I did that for many.  
For example, the President of China was supposed to go to Victoria to receive a doctorate. 
We could not guarantee him that there would be no demonstrations and he declined to go. 
We knew that people could protest. 
The President of China did not accept the offer to receive a doctorate from the University of Victoria because we could not guarantee there would be no protesters.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are not demanding accountability for the Prime Minister's awareness, they are demanding accountability for the Prime Minister's actions.  
The solicitor general has already said that any witness requested to appear before the Public Complaints Commission should do so, including presumably the Prime Minister.  
Does the Prime Minister agree with the solicitor general?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just said that at this moment there is an inquiry. 
It will look at all the facts. 
Nobody has asked me to appear.  
Under the circumstances we looked at the precedence and it is not usual in Canada for the Prime Minister to appear in front of a commission. 
It has never happened before. 
We will see what happens, but there is no need now. 
I am not preoccupied. 
I want people to let the inquiry do its work. 
The leader of the fourth party is inventing stories. 
The facts will be told to the commission in a few weeks.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister, with his answer a few moments ago in the House to the Reform members, appears to indicate that it is better to have the armed thugs of a dictator in Canada than to leave lawful and legitimate long gun owners free from government regulations and taxation.  
The truth is out there somewhere about who ordered the RCMP to stifle legitimate protesters at the APEC summit. 
The solicitor general said yesterday that the Prime Minister cannot avoid a subpoena to testify about the real story.  
Will the Prime Minister simply explain to the House his role in the pepper spray matter today? 
No one- 
The Speaker:
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to confess one thing. 
After it was all over I was asked a question about the pepper spray. 
I did not know what they were talking about.  
I asked the journalist what he meant. 
It is a product that I have never used. 
That is why I made the joke and I probably should not have made it. 
I did not know that there was a spray of pepper.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, reality seems to be imitating fiction when it comes to our American neighbours. 
Will the Prime Minister tell us why a subpoena may be necessary before he is accountable to Canadians about the APEC affair?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important to make a distinction because a couple of questions have actually represented what I said yesterday incorrectly. 
The reality is the public complaints commission can call whomever it wants. 
That is its prerogative.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
We know from documents on November 14 that the RCMP were unhappy with the political role they were asked to play in the APEC affair. 
Like the Prime Minister, we want the inquiry to work.  
Can the Prime Minister guarantee the House and Canadians that the inquiry will be allowed to investigate the office of the Prime Minister and not just look into the issue of the RCMP? 
Can it guarantee us that it will be able to look into the political role that was played in the Prime Minister's office?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the reality is the public complaints commission acts on the complaints of citizens. 
It has a wide range of opportunities to investigate and it has a good history for the last 12 years of doing Canada justice. 
These people should let that committee do its work.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let it be very clear that the solicitor general did not answer the question.  
The Prime Minister said the public complaints commission can look into those who have grievances against the RCMP. 
The question posed by my colleague is can it look into the affair from a political point of view into the Prime Minister's office and his complicity.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the hon. member does not understand that it is not for me or the government to direct it as to what to do. 
It has a job to do and it will do it.  
* * * 
SOCIAL UNION 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister responded to our questions concerning social union in a somewhat cavalier manner, irresponsibly even, going so far as to describe the government of Ontario as ultra-right. 
Really now! 
For the social union to work, there must be a minimum of openness and good faith.  
Given the importance of the social union, the problems being experienced across Canada in the health field as a result of the federal cuts, and the consensus of the premiers, can the Prime Minister brush off a serious question of such import in such a cavalier manner?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
The debate on the social union was an initiative by this Prime Minister, from this side of the House, with the premiers at the meeting of last December, almost a year ago. 
We wanted to consider social union.  
I have, however, always said, and say again today, that the five principles of health insurance, as set out in the law adopted by the Parliament of Canada with a view to assuring all Canadians of a program, are not negotiable. 
The rest, however, is.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what I understand from the Prime Minister's response is that Lucien Bouchard could have been blamed if a consensus had not been reached, which would have suited the Prime Minister, but now that there is a consensus, he no longer knows what to do. 
That is a problem.  
How, and on what basis, can the Prime Minister say that the provincial premiers want to abolish the five principles in the Canada Health Act? 
On what authority does he make that statement? 
There is nothing to that effect in the agreement.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was asked ``Are you going to accept any changes to the five principles?'' 
Instead of talking through your hat, go and read the question and the answer, to see what they were.  
* * * 
HEPATITIS C 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, is the Minister of Health proud of the fact that all hepatitis C victims in Ontario and Quebec are going to be fairly compensated, while those in other provinces who contracted the virus before 1986 will receive nothing? 
Does that make him proud?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what we propose. 
I call on the member to support us in that initiative.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this minister supposedly worked all summer on hepatitis C and what did he come up with? 
Some catchy new slogan, care instead of cash.  
This dad has no future, no car, no life insurance. 
What he wants is compassion instead of some catchy new slogan. 
When will he get compassion?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is so profoundly out of touch with Canadian values that it does not know the way Canadians show their compassion is by their health care system. 
The hon. member has no idea that the way Canadians show their concern about others is through health care.  
It is for that reason that we are now urging the provinces to join with us to ensure that those who have become sick because of the blood system, no matter when, have access to drugs and treatment they need. 
At the moment they have to pay out of their pockets in most parts of the country for interferon and important medical services.  
We are saying let us put that behind us and make sure people have the treatment they need.  
* * * 
SOCIAL UNION 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Ten premiers agreed unanimously in Saskatoon: first of all, that health is a provincial responsibility; second, that, if the federal government intervenes in this sector, the provinces should be allowed to opt out with compensation; and third, that the money spent by a province must be consistent with the federal program.  
What does the Prime Minister find unreasonable about this proposal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, when the provinces recognize that we can invest money in social programs, we are in complete agreement. 
That is why we want to be sure that we can continue to do so in a co-ordinated manner with the provinces.  
If, however, you are asking me whether we are going to rescind the Canada Health Act, the answer is no.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, nobody is asking us to rescind the five principles of the Canada Health Act. 
What we want to know is whether, if he decides to intervene in the health sector, he will allow those provinces that have programs to opt out with compensation for providing effective, quality services to the public? 
That is what people want to know.  
Why is he refusing to agree to the principle of allowing the provinces to opt out with full compensation?  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member really wants is for the federal government to withdraw from the health sector.  
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:
That is indeed what he is saying. 
He is saying that the provinces must be compensated instead of allowing the federal government to play a role in the health sector.  
The Canada Health Act and the five principles it sets out will remain part of federal legislation and we will make sure that there is one health system for all Canadians.  
* * * 
CANADA PENSION PLAN 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Yesterday the finance minister told us the firing was just an internal matter. 
We need to be clear on this issue. 
Is the minister telling this House that he had absolutely no idea that Canada's chief actuary was being dismissed from his post?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, neither the minister nor his office was involved in the decision. 
The minister was informed afterwards. 
This was a purely internal matter involving the superintendent of financial institutions and the public service.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is pretty hard to believe that the minister had no idea that such an important civil servant was being dismissed just before he was to give a major report on the Canada pension plan which has already given the government no end of trouble.  
Is the minister saying that top officials, people who are independent and whom Canadians rely on for good independent advice, can just be thrown out the door and he does not even know that this happens?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member ought to understand the way the system works in this country. 
We have separated politics from the good administration of the public service. 
The public service takes its own decisions. 
The superintendent, in conjunction with the public service, had managerial differences with the chief actuary.  
In addition, the hon. member will have plenty of opportunity to pursue her line of questioning. 
It is my understanding the House of Commons finance committee has struck a subcommittee to look into this matter as soon as the former chief actuary has had full recourse for- 
The Speaker:
The hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.  
* * * 
MONTREAL CONGRESS CENTRE 
Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the business community, the FTQ, the National Bank and all the economic stakeholders of Montreal are asking the federal government to help fund the expansion of the Montreal congress centre.  
And yet, we learned this morning that the Minister of Industry has said he does not have one cent to put into this project, despite the statement made by the secretary of state for regional development.  
How does the minister reconcile his statement that he has no money for the Montreal congress centre with the remarks made yesterday by the secretary of state for regional development in Quebec, who said he was working hard to come up with a solution?  
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to repeat what I said yesterday, which was absolutely clear, we do not need anyone to tell us the economic importance of the congress centre.  
My colleague is saying that there is no fund or program as such, and he is right. 
However, we are working hard to come up with an alternative solution, because this is an important issue.  
* * * 
GUN CONTROL 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my questions is for the Secretary of State for the Status of Women.  
It appears obvious the Reform caucus is prepared to sacrifice the safety of some women to move forward the agenda of the National Rifle Association.  
I therefore ask the secretary of state to tell the House how the government's gun control measures have taken us forward in our goal of ending violence against women.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Simcoe-Grey for an extremely pertinent and important question.  
When we speak about safety and security for our citizens, the government does not see women as special interest groups, as the opposition party does. 
We see them as members of the public. 
Seventy-eight per cent of spousal homicide is done by guns in this country. 
One woman is killed every six days with a gun in this country. 
So when we bring out gun control legislation, it is our first step in creating a safe society for the women of this country.  
* * * 
THE CONSTITUTION 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, can the Prime Minister tell us exactly what constitutes a clear majority for a referendum in Quebec? 
I ask this because the will of 91% of Albertans for an elected Senate was ignored last week.  
Now that we know what the Prime Minister thinks about a clear majority in Alberta, how in the world can Quebeckers believe he is going to respect a clear majority in Quebec? 
Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the clear majority that would be required to break apart a country will be the subject of a debate.  
We could ask the Reform Party what majority is required to amend its own constitution. 
If I am to believe clause 7, it reads as follows: 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer to his question is that it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister of Canada to name a senator and I named Mr. Roche with great pride because he will be a great senator. 
Even the members of the Reform Party agree with that selection.  
Why we have done this and not called elections for senators is because we want a real reform of the Senate, not just on voting but on equality. 
Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. member says, the main issue in this in the United States is politics. 
It is not about food safety, health or the quality of the Canadian food product.  
The Minister of Foreign Affairs will be having discussions this evening with the secretary of state in the United States. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I appreciate that he has had some phone conversations.  
Is that what he is telling the House today?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We will continue to pressure and point out to the Americans that they are breaking international law.  
* * * 
1450 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Myron Thompson:
Some hon. members:
Oh, oh.  
Mr. Myron Thompson:
We have free votes.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson:
Mr. Speaker, I would support anything that would be voluntary. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Clair, Lib.):
He says ``Maybe not all Canadians are sheep. 
What is this? 
Mr. Myron Thompson:
Mr. Speaker, I cannot say for sure. 
He could be a Liberal for all I know. 
I do not know the man.  
No way in the world would we support that.  
I hear a ``ha'' from over there. 
I do not support anybody breaking the law. 
What I support are good laws. 
This is a bad law. 
Please look at it carefully. 
It is a bad law. 
Registration has not worked anywhere effectively.  
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oxford. 
I heard the member for Wild Rose say, and this is pretty close to a quote, we will have to get the Hansard to check, that he would support anything if it was voluntary. 
I think that is what I heard him say.  
Does that mean then that criminals are going to voluntarily register? 
On one hand they are saying that criminals will not register their guns. 
That is what I heard.  
He just does not want it to be a forced situation. 
You would have thought that these gentlemen and women would be lining up behind everything these groups had to say. 
What he is really saying is that he is the Leader of the Opposition and therefore he is going to oppose it, whether it is good legislation or not.  
When I see the province of Ontario deciding that it is going to lower the age for hunting to 12 I get a little nervous. 
If they would deal with the facts then we could have a calm discussion about the issue of gun control, registration and the costs involved. 
There will be setup costs and startup costs. 
We hear that it will be expensive, that they are going to jack the price of registration up. 
I have never heard anyone mention that once the gun is registered it is registered for life. 
The one I love is that the police are going to be able to break down the door and come running in with their dogs and their guns drawn. 
They must either have our permission or they must have a warrant issued properly in a court of law, giving them permission to be able to enter and investigate. 
They would do that if they thought there was potential for abuse or potential for crime.  
Mr. Speaker, during the debate today the aspersions that have been thrown in this direction have been rather interesting.  
I was elected fortunately in 1993 with 49% of the plurality. 
In 1997 I was elected with 62%. 
The difference of the 13% was the way the Liberals rammed Bill C-68 down the throats of all Canadians. 
This member has obviously not read the bill. 
The bill is about Liberal social engineering. 
The bill is about an understanding that the Liberals have only from their own specific urban perspective. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney:
The member does not understand that this is not a debate about the bill, this is a debate about the implementation and the regulations. 
I believe he is serious in his comments in terms of reflecting the views of his constituents.  
Eleven hundred of those people commit suicide by firearms. 
Would these people likely not commit suicide using a firearm if it was registered? 
About 100 people are killed in hunting accidents each year. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Reform Party motion on Bill C-68 with which we dealt in the last parliament. 
It is interesting that the Reform Party is using its first opposition day in the new fall session to debate an issue on which it fought and lost an election rather than using it for other important issues that Canadians are concerned with. 
Where is the vision? 
It states: 
That this House condemns the government for its refusal to replace Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, with legislation targeting the criminal misuse of firearms and revoke their firearm registration policy that, in the opinion of this House: (a) confiscates private property- 
Two days after I was elected my friend, the former warden of Oxford county, died in a hunting accident. 
His wife wanted to throw all his guns down the well that afternoon.  
It ``is an affront to law-abiding firearms owners'' to ask them to register a gun, to ask them to pay a small fee for that privilege. 
Before the last election Reformers swarmed across southwestern Ontario telling our constituents, mine in particular, that voters had to send a clear message to the Liberal government about gun control and Bill C-68. 
I am sure many Reformers were embarrassed that the only Reform MP to hold a seat in Ontario voted against gun control and that seat was won by a Liberal MP. 
Several of them have positions in the leadership of the anti-Bill C-68 lobby. 
It is true that criminals will be unlikely to register a firearm. 
Everyone can concede that point, but people must also concede that by that very fact criminals will identify themselves. 
The fact that a firearm is not registered will alert the police to the possibility that the firearm may have been stolen, illegally imported, illegally manufactured or bought on the black market.  
The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian Police Association, the Canadian Association of Police Boards and groups representing victims of crime support registration of all firearms for practical reasons, the same reasons that we register our cars, our bicycles, our birth, our citizenship and so on.  
It will allow information on safe storage and handling regulations to be directed specifically to firearm owners.  
With these rules and regulations and the education of firearm owners regarding proper storage, it will certainly prevent a lot of people being killed by unloaded guns, the situations where the child in the home points an loaded gun at somebody but when father put it away it was unloaded. 
Quite clearly, if a gun is registered the owner has the possession certificate and there is nothing to fear in the bill. 
I applaud them, all three. 
Those members mentioned represented Calgary Centre, Edmonton Southwest and Vancouver North.  
A majority of Canadians support the gun registry including those in British Columbia and Alberta where most Reformers are from. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. John Finlay:
Mr. Speaker, I suppose I agree with my hon. colleague that registering a gun may not in and of itself prevent a crime. 
The hon. member said that the bill was not about decreasing crime and then went on to tell a tragic story about an accidental death.  
I will repeat what my hon. colleague mentioned. 
Most democratic countries in this world have gun control rules or gun registration. 
It is a perfectly good conclusion.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They can sit there and they are his. 
Mr. John Finlay:
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
However, it is for the reason that Bill C-68 is going to make our streets less safe that we oppose it. 
I will get to the reason why.  
Point one is the registration of guns. 
In this country two-thirds of the people who are murdered are murdered with a weapon that is not a gun. 
One-third die of gunshot wounds. 
The point I am trying to make is that the cost of gun registration is going to be hundreds of millions of dollars and the government's estimate is over $1 billion. 
But in large part it is going to come out of the functional arm of justice. 
That means if we are going to remove money from the RCMP, if we are going to remove money from the police forces we had better make sure that where we are putting it has better bang for the buck. 
But the reality is it will not.  
He said any price is worth it. 
We have proven that it will not. 
The second reason is that the minister said it will decrease suicides. 
1550 
The facts are that gun registration will do nothing to decrease the suicide rate. 
This is standard procedure.  
The men and women on the front lines of justice in this country know full well that the money is going to come out of their funds to fight crime. 
Accidental death with a firearm is a function of the use of that firearm. 
It is a tragedy of people not using guns properly. 
Gun registration will do nothing for that.  
If the government were truly interested in decreasing crime then it would hit crime where it counts. 
When those people commit an offence with a firearm what happens? 
What message does that send to the criminals?  
This means that there is no penalty whatsoever for those people who use firearms in the commission of an offence. 
That is what our party has been fighting for so long.  
What we must do is enforce the law. 
We must stop plea bargaining away those sentences. 
If a criminal is guilty of pulling out a gun in the commission of a robbery then we should hit them with the book. 
We must make sure they pay the penalty so they know they will not get off scot free when using firearms.  
The penalties for trafficking are there but they are not being applied. 
That is a serious problem because it ties the hands of our law enforcement officers when these offences are occurring in front of their eyes. 
Good effective justice and good effective laws would ensure that the laws of this country are being applied in the courts and not merely pushed underneath the carpet. 
It is a serious offence for law abiding citizens, who have never been a criminal in their lives, to transfer their guns to their children and loved ones. 
If it is not going to make our streets safer, if it is not going to save Canadian lives, if it is not going to increase the safety of people, if it is not going to improve the ability of the police to do their job, then why do it?  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca reminds me that the first dead person I saw was a suicide victim with a shotgun. 
Subsequently I became a police reporter, a journalist, and I saw a lot of murders and suicides in the course of that part of my career. 
One of the things I learned about suicides is that there are two things that often operate. 
What they prefer is something that is instantaneous and something also that will answer their impulses.  
I was very surprised that he said the opposite because gun registration surely would save the lives of some suicides.  
I am glad the hon. member mentioned the issue that suicide can be impulsive. 
It can also be a part of an ongoing major depression and the person can be ruminating about this for a long time.  
More deaths were averted in this tragic incident. 
What happened when this bear attacked those people? 
Someone had to run back along the boardwalk and find someone who happened to have a firearm in their recreational vehicle. 
I am not sure whether it was a motorhome or a fifth wheel trailer. 
To me that is the fundamental issue.  
They would argue that we did not need parts of that legislation or it should not be applied the same in Toronto as it is at Liard Hot Springs in northeastern British Columbia.  
It would make the minimum five-year sentence consecutive to any other sentence and would apply to any accomplices who had access to the firearm during the crime or attempted crime whether or not the gun was fired.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the sincerity with which the member made his remarks but in making his remarks he betrayed some of the lack of understanding of the west with respect to Ontario and central Canada.  
There is wilderness in central Canada. 
At my cottage in the summer, I killed a three foot rattlesnake. 
My cottage just happens to be in the range of the only poisonous snake in Canada.  
I do not understand how non-registration would have somehow prevented this terrible incident in Liard River Hot Springs.  
The government can arbitrarily decide that certain makes, models and types of firearms are suddenly on the prohibited list. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise with some considerable interest in this issue as it is a matter of great interest to Canadians and to my constituents.  
Bill C-68 which was passed in the last parliament and the proclamation of the attendant regulations scheduled for October 1 and now postponed to December 1.  
The principles behind Bill C-68 were quite eloquently stated by the president for the Coalition for Gun Control. 
They are the significant costs of not acting now in terms of victimization, years of life lost and economic impact. 
The remedy is understood, available, feasible and at a reasonable cost. 
In other words, gun registration addresses current problems and it invests in the future.  
The single most important motivation behind the bill is public safety and the safety of police officers. 
I frankly have trouble understanding the position of the members of the Reform Party. 
Are they in fact against public safety? 
I have trouble believing that the hon. member who proposed the motion wishes to go in that direction. 
This is a piece of legislation which is broadly supported by the Canadian public and the constituents in my riding.  
I would draw the hon. member's attention to a recent Angus Reid poll in which 82% of Canadians approved the universal registration of shotguns and rifles. 
Contrary to the thesis of the member previous to me, interestingly there was 72% support in rural communities.  
Last week the reformatories proclaimed legislation enabling 12 year olds to be licensed. 
Canada has not been nor, if this legislator has any say about it, will ever be a country in which the right to bear arms is a constitutional, legal or moral mandate. 
This motion deserves strong rebuke from the House as it defeats itself.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the suggestion that weapons control or the registration of firearms will actually enhance their value is one of the funniest things I have ever heard said in the House.  
As we speak, firearms dealers in the northern tier states are scooping up enormous quantities of Canadian owned firearms at bargain basement prices because people want to get rid of them before the regulations come fully into effect. 
People in this country have collections of heritage weapons. 
This seems to be fairly fundamental. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the first point with respect to the proliferation of guns. 
It is my view that a great number of homicides are committed by people who know each other; in fact something in the order of 90%. 
What the National Firearms Association in the United States is all about is that it is afraid there will be a new world order set up in Europe that will persuade the president of the United States to disarm all Americans and that they will lose their guns and live under tyranny.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are quite a few indications of interest in questions and comments. 
We will go first to Nanaimo-Cowichan, second to Yellowhead and third to Battlefords-Lloydminster, but members will have to keep their questions and responses short.
