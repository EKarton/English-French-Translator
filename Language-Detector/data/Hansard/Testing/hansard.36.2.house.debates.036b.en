NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
The House resumed from December 6, consideration of Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 5.30 p.m., pursuant to order made on Monday, December 6, 1999, the House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred recorded divisions on the report stage of Bill C-9.  
Call in the members.  
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Peter Adams:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know that you like me believe that this is a serious place, a place where tradition is important and where people should be properly dressed.  
I would point out that the member for Langley-Abbotsford, a member of the Reform Party, is improperly dressed.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am now able to see the hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
I think it might be more productive if we proceeded with the voting. 
However, normally the enforcement occurs when a member wishes to address the House. 
Since we are not expecting speeches tonight and are voting, I am not proposing to take further steps at this time.  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
A negative vote on Motion No. 1 requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 2 and 3.

Mr. Peter Stoffer:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I just cannot sit here without putting on record that the political mischief by the Reform Party could very well cost our pages their marks on their exams because they are in the exam period at this time. 
I find it unfair that they have to suffer along with the rest of us.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am afraid that is not a point of order. 
If the whip of the official opposition is rising on a different point of order, I would want to hear him.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent that the House would let the pages go home at this time.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.

No.

I believe everyone in the House must be fiscally responsible. 
I ask the Leader of the Opposition if he understands that this will cost $2.4 million by tomorrow night.  
The Deputy Speaker:
That is not a point of order.  
Mr. Preston Manning:
Mr. Speaker, if this treaty goes through in its defective form it will cost the country billions of dollars.

The Chair is very much afraid we are getting into debate.

Mr. Greg Thompson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I bring to your attention the sixth edition of Beauchesne's, page 98, citation 329 on quorum in the House. 
Will I be allowed to quote from Beauchesne's on this point of order?  
The Deputy Speaker:
Yes.  
Mr. Greg Thompson:
Let me do so. 
It states: 
The Standing Orders of the House are virtually silent on the subject of Members' dress. 
Standing Order 17 requires that a Member who wishes to speak must rise uncovered. 
While the wearing of hats in the Chamber has a respectable historical tradition, Speakers in recent years have frowned on unorthodox headgear.  
It goes on: 
Many Speakers have ruled that male Members must wear a jacket, shirt and tie, and on rare occasions, such as Burns Day- 
It is not Burns Day. 
Citation 330 states on page 99 states: 
A jacket and tie are required to be worn by male Members.  
We have at least two members in the Reform Party who are not following procedure. 
We object to that.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
It appears that we will be here for a while. 
I notice the member for Davenport does not have a tie on but that does not bother us. 
I think people can vote as they see fit. 
It would be different perhaps if we were giving speeches. 
I think we can handle it okay.  
The Deputy Speaker:
If we are only going to be here for a few more minutes I am sure hon. members will want to put their jackets on. 
It is quite clear that the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest is correct. 
The Chair is not intending to be a stickler on the subject of dress. 
I have made it clear that no member who wishes to rise on a point of order will be recognized unless that member is properly attired. 
I would hope that members will behave accordingly.  
Mr. Greg Thompson:
No, Mr. Speaker, neither do we because, as the member for Saint John pointed out, it is costing the Canadian taxpayer between now and tomorrow morning $2.5 million. 
I contend that a member cannot rise in this place to vote without proper attire.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The point of order by the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest is well taken. 
Members who are not properly attired will not be counted in the voting.  
Some hon. members:
Hear, hear.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
The Deputy Speaker:
Here on in.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, it does seem to me that only a Tory would worry about a tie when there are billions of dollars that we are all voting on here tonight.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Well, we all try to help one another.  
The question is on Motion No. 17. 
A negative vote on Motion No. 17 requires the question to be put on Motion No. 18.

The Deputy Speaker:
Is there unanimous consent?  
Some hon. members:
Agreed.  
An hon. member:
No. 
Mr. Bob Kilger:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not doubt that everyone feels the same way about what the pressures of a student might be while he or she is a page in the House, but I understand that the House has already provided shifts for the pages so that in fact they will not be here all evening as the rest of us might be. 
We certainly do take the opportunity to wish them all well on their exams.  
Some hon. members:
Hear, hear.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am not sure that was a point of order either.

I understand that it is late and we have been at this for a long time. 
As members know, and I direct this to a particular member, the House has long established rules of conduct and of deportment. 
One of them is the wearing of jackets. 
I would ask the hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford, in respect for the House, to wear his jacket.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask for clarification from the Chair. 
Do members have to wear their jackets only if they are voting or otherwise? 
If members are not voting, surely they do not need to have their jackets on at this time of night.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The rule is a longstanding one that has to do with deportment in the House. 
At 10.30 in the evening we will not get into it.

Mr. Peter Adams:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I notice that the House leader for the Reform Party has put his jacket on.  
I would point out that citation 330 in Beauchesne's states that a member who is improperly dressed should not be able to vote. 
I would suggest that a vote be subtracted-

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If the motion that we are about to vote on, Motion No. 42, were to pass, it would not be necessary to proceed with the other amendments. 
If it does not pass, we are here until at least Thursday or maybe Friday.  
You might therefore wish, Mr. Speaker, to ask the House if it wishes to defer the vote on Motion No. 42 so that members might reflect longer on whether the minister's stubbornness is worth the price.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The next question is on Motion No. 42.  
I know people are getting tired and tempers may or may not become frayed. 
There will be a certain amount of kibitzing back and forth, but if there is any meanness in the kibitzing it could deteriorate very quickly. 
I would ask all members to be very judicious in the choice of words that they are throwing back and forth.

We have had a lot of detailed little rulings tonight about whether we need a tie or a jacket on and something else. 
It is my understanding that a person is supposed to rise in his or her place to be counted for a vote. 
The minister of Indian Affairs, whose legislation this is, did not bother to stand up for the last vote or for a number of votes. 
I suggest that his vote should be subtracted from the total.

I would like to be recorded as having voted in favour of this motion.  
The Deputy Speaker:
The hon. member for Elk Island indicated he was voting yea. 
The Clerk who was calling the vote had turned to the Chair and indicated that the yeas were finished and I called the nays. 
The hon. member had not risen. 
That is why I made the call. 
I will allow the hon. member's vote to be counted at this point and he will be counted as a yea.

Mr. Randy White:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is remarkable how similar the Liberals and Tories really are in the House of Commons. 
I must say that by virtue of having a sign such as this, it reminds me of how much in the trough both the Conservatives and the Liberals are.  
Mr. Peter Adams:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I heard you rule on the sign. 
I wonder if you could rule on the sign that I have been using which says that the Reform Party is costing us $30,000 an hour.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I do not think any of the interventions have been helpful to the Chair, with all respect. 
Is this a different point? 
I do not want to hear more about costs.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
No, Mr. Speaker, it is not about costs. 
It is about some of the words that were fired over to us during the last voting procedure particularly angry that the NDP only got 2.5% in the byelection- 
The Deputy Speaker:
This is the same kind of helpful comment. 
We will move on.

Mr. Derrek Konrad:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Earlier, one of the other speakers had mentioned that members should be sitting and not moving around the House while the vote is taken. 
There was so much activity on the government side, I doubt whether the results of the last vote were correct. 
I think we should vote again on that motion.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Members are supposed to remain in their seats during the taking of a vote. 
It is very helpful to the Chair and to the table officers if that were the case. 
However, I was watching the vote and I do not think there was a problem.  
Mr. John Cannis:

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know you have been very fussy about things like dress code and so on, but could you please explain whether it is all right for a member of parliament to be taking pictures with his camera in here while we are voting. 
I noticed Bill Matthews was doing that just a minute ago. 
I wonder if that was appropriate.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I am also sure that members would not be taking picture in the House. 
I can assure the hon. member that this will be actively discouraged. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl:
Mr. Speaker, perhaps you would like to ask the member as he is in the House. 
I believe he is wandering about taking pictures. 
I think it is very inappropriate. 
Perhaps you would like to ask him what he is planning to do with it. 
I do not know what he is doing.  
The Deputy Speaker:
I do not think it is necessary to ask. 
I can understand the desire of many to take pictures when there are so many photogenic subjects in the House.

Mr. Speaker, I think perhaps we should ask them to include the record number of time allocations and closures that the Liberals have brought in as another abuse to democracy, and that is why we are here tonight.  
The Deputy Speaker:
Might I suggest to hon. members that we look at the most recent editions to see if they are more helpful.  
The next question is on Motion No. 135.

Mr. Jason Kenney:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find that the member for Davenport, who recently rose to express his dismay with the lack of complete authoritarian power by the government to crack this symbol of dissent, is consuming food in the Chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for bringing that to my attention.  
I would ask, as we did last night, when the vote caller is calling a particular side of the Chamber that members not stand between the vote caller and the persons being called. 
There are people coming in and out. 
We need to make it as easy as possible for the vote callers.  
Obviously we will not be eating or drinking. 
We will treat this Chamber with the respect it deserves.
